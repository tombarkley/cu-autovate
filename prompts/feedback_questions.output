Here is an example:
```
[
    {
        "question": "What do you like about the product?",
        "response_type": "text"
    },
    {
        "question": "What do you dislike about the product?",
        "response_type": "text"
    },
    {
        "question": "What would you change about the product?",
        "response_type": "text"
    },
    {
        "question": "How would you improve the product?",
        "response_type": "text"
    },
    {
        "question": "On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to sign up for this product yourself?",
        "response_type": "number_scale"
    },
    {
        "question": "On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to recommend this product to a friend?",
        "response_type": "number_scale"
    },
    {
        "question": "What other feedback do you have?",
        "response_type": "text"
    }
]
```
"response_type" can be "text" or "number_scale" only.  
If it is "number_scale" the question itself must request an answer on a scale of 1-10.
You can use questions included in the example above or create your own.
Please return [question_count] questions.
