It's convenient and saves me time compared to going to a physical branch or using an ATM."}, {"What would make you switch from your current digital banking provider to our service?": "As Megan, I would switch to your service if it offered more innovative features than my current provider. For example, if MoneyWISE provides personalized financial advice based on my unique situation, that would be a big draw for me.

Additionally, if there were exclusive discounts or promotions only available through the app, that would also encourage me to engage more frequently."}]
