[{"What features are most important to you in a digital banking service?": "As a marketing specialist, I think it's important to have a personalized and comprehensive view of my finances. I would like to see personalized budgeting tools that track my income and expenses, including automatic categorization of transactions and alerts for unusual spending. I also want customizable savings goals with progress tracking and personalized recommendations for savings accounts, CDs, and investment products. Additionally, financial planning tools that help me plan for short-term and long-term goals, such as paying off debt, saving for college or retirement, or buying a home, would be very useful. Finally, interactive educational content that helps me learn about personal finance topics, such as credit building, investing strategies, and tax planning, would be a great bonus."}, {"How frequently do you use digital banking services?": "As a busy marketing specialist, I use digital banking services frequently, at least once a day. I check my account balances, transfer funds, and pay bills online or through mobile apps. I also use digital banking services to track my spending and savings goals."}, {"What would make you switch from your current digital banking provider to our service?": "To make me switch from my current digital banking provider to your service, I would need to see that your service offers more personalized and comprehensive financial management tools than my current provider. Additionally, I would like to see that your service is secure and easy to use. If your service provides a seamless user experience with a user-friendly interface, and if it offers better interest rates on savings accounts and lower fees, I would be more likely to switch. Finally, if your service offers better customer support and educational resources, that would also be a strong selling point for me."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to try out our new digital banking service?": "As an outgoing, creative, and driven marketing specialist, I am always looking for ways to improve my financial management skills and achieve my goals.
