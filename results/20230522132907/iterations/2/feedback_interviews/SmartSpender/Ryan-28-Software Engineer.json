[{"What features are most important to you in a digital banking service?": "As a software engineer, I value convenience and efficiency in any digital service. So, features like automatic categorization of spending, personalized insights and recommendations, and easy-to-use goal-setting tools are important to me. I also appreciate the ability to split expenses with friends and family easily, as this is something that can be a hassle with traditional banking services."}, {"How frequently do you use digital banking services?": "I use digital banking services almost every day. I prefer the convenience of being able to manage my finances from my phone or computer, rather than having to go to a physical bank location."}, {"What would make you switch from your current digital banking provider to our service?": "If your SmartSpender app offered more personalized insights and recommendations, and had a more user-friendly interface than my current provider, I would definitely consider switching. Additionally, if your app had unique features that my current provider doesn't offer, such as the ability to split expenses with friends and family easily, that would also be a strong incentive for me to switch. Finally, if your app had better security features, that would also be a major factor in my decision to switch."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to try out our new digital banking service?": "As someone who values convenience and efficiency in digital services, and who is always looking for ways to better manage my finances, I would rate my likelihood of trying out your new digital banking service as an 8."}, {"What kind of rewards or incentives would encourage you to engage more frequently with our mobile app?": "As someone who values financial stability, I would be interested in rewards or incentives that help me save money or earn cashback on purchases. For example, if your app offered cashback rewards for certain spending categories or had a savings account with a higher interest rate than my current provider, that would definitely encourage me to engage more frequently with your mobile app. Additionally, if there were gamification elements that made tracking my financial progress more fun or engaging, that would also be a strong incentive for me to use the app more often."}]
