[{"What features are most important to you in a digital banking service?": "As a marketing manager, I'm always looking for innovative features that can help me manage my finances better. Real-time updates on balances and transactions, personalized spending insights and alerts, and a budgeting tool with customizable categories and spending limits are all important to me. Additionally, the ability to easily split expenses with friends and family using the app and mobile check deposit are convenient features that I would find useful. Lastly, having a savings goal feature to help me save for short-term and long-term financial goals would be a great addition."}, {"How frequently do you use digital banking services?": "As a busy marketing manager, I use digital banking services frequently. I check my account balances and transaction history daily, make payments and transfers, and deposit checks using mobile check deposit. I also use budgeting tools to track my spending and savings progress. So, I would say I use digital banking services on a daily basis."}, {"What would make you switch from your current digital banking provider to our service?": "To make me switch from my current digital banking provider to your service, I would need to see that your service offers more innovative and user-friendly features than what I currently have. If your MoneyTracker app can provide me with better insights into my spending habits, help me save money, and make it easier for me to manage my finances on-the-go, then I would definitely consider switching to your service. Additionally, if your service is more secure and offers better customer support than my current provider, that would also be a factor in my decision to switch."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to try out our new digital banking service?": "As someone who is always looking for innovative ways to manage my finances, I would rate my likelihood of trying out your new digital banking service as an 8 out of 10. The MoneyTracker app seems to offer many features that align with my financial goals and needs, such as personalized spending insights and alerts, a budgeting tool with customizable categories and spending limits, and a savings goal feature. However, I would need to learn more about the app's security measures and customer support before making a final decision."}, {"What kind of rewards or incentives would encourage you to engage more frequently with our mobile app?": "As someone who values achievement and adventure, I would be motivated to engage more frequently with your mobile app if there were rewards or incentives that help me achieve my financial goals. For example, if you offered cashback rewards for reaching certain savings milestones or for using the app to make payments or deposits, that would be a great incentive for me to use the app more often. Additionally, if you offered exclusive discounts or deals on products or services for credit union members who use the app, that would also be a great motivator for me to engage more frequently with the app."}]
