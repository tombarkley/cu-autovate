[{"What features would you like to see in a digital banking service?": "As a graphic designer who values creativity and authenticity, I would like to see a digital banking service that is user-friendly and visually appealing.

Overall, I want a service that can simplify my financial management and help me achieve my financial goals."}, {"How often do you use mobile banking services?": "I use mobile banking services quite frequently, at least once a day. I rely on my mobile banking app to check my account balances, review recent transactions, and transfer funds between accounts. It's convenient and saves me time from having to visit a physical branch or use a desktop computer."}, {"What would make you switch to a different digital banking service?": "If a different digital banking service offered more advanced features, a better user experience, or more competitive rates and fees, I would consider switching. Additionally, if my current credit union's digital banking service had frequent glitches or was not reliable, it would also prompt me to consider switching to a different service."}, {"How important is it for you to have frequent engagement with your credit union through their mobile app?": "As a busy graphic designer, I value convenience and efficiency. While I appreciate having access to my credit union's mobile app for basic financial management tasks, I don't necessarily need frequent engagement with the credit union through the app. However, if the credit union were to offer personalized financial advice or alerts about potential savings opportunities or investment options, I would be more likely to engage with the app on a regular basis.
