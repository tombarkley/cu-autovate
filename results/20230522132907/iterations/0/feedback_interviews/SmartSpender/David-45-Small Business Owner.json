Specifically, I would like to see features that allow me to categorize my spending automatically, set and track my financial goals, and get personalized insights and recommendations about my spending habits. It would also be great if the service had an easy-to-use interface for splitting expenses with friends and family. Lastly, mobile check deposit would be a huge plus for me."}, {"How often do you use mobile banking services?": "As a busy small business owner, I use mobile banking services almost every day. I rely on mobile banking to check my account balances, transfer funds between accounts, pay bills, and deposit checks. It's convenient and saves me a lot of time."}, {"What would make you switch to a different digital banking service?": "I would switch to a different digital banking service if it offered better features and functionality than my current service. For example, if a new service had more advanced budgeting and savings tools, or if it provided more personalized insights and recommendations about my spending habits, I would definitely consider switching.
