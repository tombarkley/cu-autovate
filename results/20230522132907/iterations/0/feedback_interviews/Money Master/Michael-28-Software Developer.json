[{"What features would you like to see in a digital banking service?": "As a software developer, I appreciate services that are user-friendly and intuitive. It would be great to have personalized budgeting tools that allow me to track my spending and savings goals. Goal tracking and reminders would also be helpful to monitor my progress. Additionally, I would like to receive personalized recommendations for financial products and services based on my spending habits and financial needs. Lastly, having the ability to link all my accounts and view all my financial information in one place would be a huge plus."}, {"How often do you use mobile banking services?": "I use mobile banking services almost every day. I check my account balances, transfer funds, and pay bills through my mobile banking app. It's convenient and saves me a lot of time."}, {"What would make you switch to a different digital banking service?": "If a different digital banking service offered better features, more convenience, or better customer service, I would consider switching. Additionally, if my current credit union's digital banking service became outdated or didn't keep up with the latest technology, I would also consider switching to a different service."}, {"How important is it for you to have frequent engagement with your credit union through their mobile app?": "It's moderately important for me to have frequent engagement with my credit union through their mobile app. While I don't necessarily need to engage with them every day, it's important to have access to my financial information and be able to perform necessary transactions whenever I need to. If there are any issues with my account, having a responsive and helpful customer service team is more important to me than frequent engagement through the mobile app."}, {"What concerns do you have about using a new digital banking service?": "One of my main concerns about using a new digital banking service is the security of my personal and financial information. I want to make sure that the service has strong security measures in place to protect my information from hackers and cyber attacks. Additionally, I would be concerned about any hidden fees or costs associated with using the service. Finally, I would want to make sure that the service is reliable and doesn't experience frequent outages or technical issues that could impact my ability to access my accounts or perform transactions."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to sign up for our new digital banking service?": "As a software developer who values personalized financial management tools and convenience, I would rate my likelihood of signing up for your new digital banking service as 8 out of 10. However, it would depend on the specific features and benefits of the service, as well as the reputation of your credit union and the security measures in place to protect my personal and financial information."}, {"What could we do to make you more likely to sign up for our new digital banking service?": "To make me more likely to sign up for your new digital banking service, I would want to see that it offers innovative features that are not available with other digital banking services. For example, personalized budgeting tools, goal tracking, and personalized recommendations for financial products and services based on my spending habits and financial needs would be appealing to me. Additionally, I would want to see that your credit union has a strong reputation for customer service and security, and that any fees or costs associated with the service are transparent and reasonable."}]
