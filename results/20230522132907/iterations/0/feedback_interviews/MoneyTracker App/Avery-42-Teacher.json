[{"What features would you like to see in a digital banking service?": "As a teacher who values education, I would like to see a digital banking service that can help me learn more about personal finance and budgeting. It would be great if the service could provide personalized insights and alerts based on my spending habits. I would also like to have a budgeting tool with customizable categories and spending limits, as well as a savings goal feature to help me save for short-term and long-term financial goals. Finally, it would be convenient to have a mobile check deposit feature so I can make deposits without visiting a branch."}, {"How often do you use mobile banking services?": "I use mobile banking services occasionally, about once a week."}, {"What would make you switch to a different digital banking service?": "I would switch to a different digital banking service if it offered better features and benefits than my current service, such as more personalized insights and alerts, easier budget tracking, and more convenient mobile check deposit options. I would also consider switching if the service had better security features and a more user-friendly interface. Finally, if the service had lower fees or better interest rates on savings accounts, that would also be a factor in my decision to switch."}, {"How important is it for you to have frequent engagement with your credit union through their mobile app?": "As an introverted person, frequent engagement with my credit union through their mobile app is not a top priority for me. However, I do appreciate having access to my account information and the ability to perform transactions on-the-go, so I would say it is moderately important."}, {"What concerns do you have about using a new digital banking service?": "My main concern about using a new digital banking service would be security. I want to make sure that my personal and financial information is protected from hackers and other cyber threats. I would also want to make sure that the service is reliable and has a good track record of uptime and customer service. Finally, I would want to make sure that the service is user-friendly and easy to navigate, so I don't get frustrated or confused while using it."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to sign up for our new digital banking service?": "As someone who values education and wants to take control of their finances, I would rate my likelihood of signing up for your new digital banking service as an 8 out of 10. The features you described, such as personalized spending insights, budget tracking, and savings goals, are very appealing to me. However, I would need to learn more about the security measures in place and the user interface before making a final decision."}, {"What could we do to make you more likely to sign up for our new digital banking service?": "To make me more likely to sign up for your new digital banking service, you could offer a free trial period or a promotional offer for new members. This would give me a chance to try out the service and see if it meets my needs without committing to a long-term contract. Additionally, you could provide more information about the security measures in place and how you protect members' personal and financial information. Finally, if you could offer more customization options for the budgeting tool and savings goal feature, that would be a big selling point for me."}]
