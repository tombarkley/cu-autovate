- One thing that would make me more likely to use this product is if there were some sort of rewards program or cashback incentives for using my Savings Accelerator account. For example, if I could earn points or cashback for using my debit card or making purchases through the credit union, that would be a great added bonus. Additionally, it would be helpful if there were more resources available to help me set and achieve my financial goals, such as financial planning tools or personalized advice from a financial advisor.

**How easy or difficult do you think it would be to use this product?**:

The process of opening an account, setting financial goals, and choosing a level of commitment all sound straightforward and user-friendly. I also appreciate that there are automatic transfer options available to help me stay on track with my savings goals. The online and mobile banking tools also sound very convenient and easy to use. Overall, I think this product would be very accessible and user-friendly for me.

**On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to sign up for this product yourself?**:
