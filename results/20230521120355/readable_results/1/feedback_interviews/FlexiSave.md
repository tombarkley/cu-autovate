Additionally, the ability to set up automatic savings transfers would be a valuable feature for me.

**On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to recommend this product to a friend?**: 

- As someone who values flexibility and ease of use in a savings account, I would rate my likelihood of recommending FlexiSave to a friend as a 9 out of 10. The competitive interest rates, no minimum balance requirements, and user-friendly digital tools make it a very attractive option for anyone looking to save money and achieve their financial goals. The only reason I wouldn't rate it a 10 out of 10 is because I would want to make sure that there are no hidden fees or penalties for early withdrawals before recommending it to a friend.

**What other suggestions or feedback do you have for improving this product?**: 

- One suggestion I have for improving this product is to offer additional incentives for members who maintain a certain balance or make regular deposits. For example, offering a higher interest rate for members who maintain a balance of $1,000 or more could be a good way to incentivize saving and encourage members to reach their financial goals faster. Additionally, offering rewards or bonuses for members who make regular deposits could be a good way to encourage consistent saving habits. Overall, I think these types of incentives would make FlexiSave an even more attractive savings option for members.
