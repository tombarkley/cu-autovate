## Andrew-28-Software Engineer

**What features of this product appeal to you?**: 

- As a software engineer, I appreciate the flexibility that SmartSaver offers with its contribution options. It's great that customers can choose their own savings goals and track their progress towards them using the mobile app or online banking. Additionally, the fact that there are no monthly fees or minimum balance requirements is a huge plus for me. Lastly, the competitive interest rates that increase as customers reach their savings goals is a great incentive to save more.

**What concerns do you have about using this product?**: 

- As someone who values honesty, I would like to know more about the terms and conditions of the account. For example, are there any hidden fees or penalties for withdrawing money before reaching a savings goal? Additionally, I would like to know more about the security measures in place to protect my personal and financial information. Lastly, I would like to know how easy it is to access my funds when I need them.

**Is there anything missing from this product that would make you more likely to use it?**: 

- As someone who enjoys hiking and traveling, I would love to see some sort of rewards program or travel perks associated with the SmartSaver account. For example, maybe customers could earn points towards discounted flights or hotel stays when they reach certain savings goals. Additionally, it would be great if there were some sort of financial education resources available to help customers learn more about personal finance and how to make the most of their savings.

**How easy or difficult do you think it would be to use this product?**: 

- Based on the product features and mechanics, I think SmartSaver would be relatively easy to use. The ability to set up automatic contributions and track progress towards savings goals using the mobile app or online banking is very convenient. Additionally, the lack of monthly fees or minimum balance requirements makes it easy to get started with the account. However, I would need to see the actual user interface and experience before making a final judgement on how easy or difficult it is to use.

**On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to sign up for this product yourself?**: 

- As someone who values financial stability and is actively saving for a down payment on a house, I would rate my likelihood of signing up for SmartSaver as an 8 out of 10.

Additionally, the lack of monthly fees or minimum balance requirements is a big selling point.

**What other suggestions or feedback do you have for improving this product?**: 

- One suggestion I have for improving this product is to offer some sort of incentive for reaching savings goals. For example, customers could earn a bonus interest rate or cash reward when they reach certain milestones. This would not only motivate customers to save more, but also make them feel rewarded for their efforts. Additionally, it would be great if there were some sort of social sharing feature that allowed customers to share their progress and savings goals with friends and family. This could help create a sense of community and accountability around saving, which could be very beneficial for many people.

**Is there anything missing from this product that would make you more likely to use it?**: 

- One thing that would make me more likely to use SmartSaver is if there were additional incentives or rewards for reaching my savings goals. For example, maybe there could be a bonus interest rate for customers who consistently meet their savings targets. Additionally, it would be great if there were resources or tools available to help me make informed decisions about my savings goals and strategies.

**How easy or difficult do you think it would be to use this product?**: 

- Based on the product features and mechanics described, I think SmartSaver would be relatively easy to use. The ability to set up automatic contributions and track progress towards savings goals using the mobile app or online banking seems very convenient. However, I would need to see the actual user interface and experience to make a more informed assessment.

**On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to sign up for this product yourself?**: 

- As a small business owner who values saving and financial planning, I would rate my likelihood of signing up for SmartSaver as an 8 out of 10. The product features and mechanics seem appealing and useful for my financial goals, but I would need to learn more about the interest rates and security measures before making a final decision.

**On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to recommend this product to a friend?**: 

- As someone who values financial planning and saving, I would rate my likelihood of recommending SmartSaver to a friend as a 9 out of 10. The product features and mechanics seem very useful and convenient for setting and tracking savings goals, and the lack of monthly fees or minimum balance requirements is a big plus. However, I would need to see the actual interest rates and security measures before making a final recommendation.

**What other suggestions or feedback do you have for improving this product?**: 

- One suggestion I have for improving SmartSaver is to offer additional resources or tools to help customers make informed decisions about their savings goals and strategies. For example, maybe there could be a financial planning tool or calculator that helps customers determine how much they need to save each month to reach their goals. Additionally, it would be great if there were educational resources available to help customers learn more about personal finance and investing. Finally, it would be helpful if the credit union could provide regular updates or notifications to customers about their progress towards their savings goals.
