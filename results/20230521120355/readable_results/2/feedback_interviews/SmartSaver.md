The SmartSaver account sounds like a great option for people like me who have specific financial goals in mind. I appreciate the flexibility of being able to choose my own savings goals and track my progress towards them using the mobile app or online banking. The competitive interest rates and no monthly fees or minimum balance requirements are also very appealing features. Overall, I think the SmartSaver account has a lot of potential to attract new members who are looking for a smarter way to save.

**What features of the product would make you consider using it?**: 

- As someone who is analytical and values personalized solutions, I really like the fact that the SmartSaver account allows me to set my own savings goals and track my progress towards them. Having the ability to choose from flexible contribution options and set up automatic contributions from my paycheck or other accounts is also a big plus for me. Additionally, the competitive interest rates that increase as I reach my savings goals is a great motivator to keep saving. Finally, the fact that there are no monthly fees or minimum balance requirements is a huge relief, as it means I can save without worrying about additional costs. Overall, these features make the SmartSaver account a very attractive option for me.

**Is there anything missing from the product that would make you more likely to use it?**:

The personalized savings goals and progress tracking, flexible contribution options, competitive interest rates, and lack of monthly fees or minimum balance requirements are all very appealing features that make the SmartSaver account a great option for me.
