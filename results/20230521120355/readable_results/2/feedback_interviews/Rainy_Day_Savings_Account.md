Additionally, if there were any cash bonuses or other rewards for opening the account or referring friends and family, that would also be a nice feature. Finally, if there were any discounts or special offers on other financial products or services offered by the credit union, that would also be a nice perk.

**What other feedback do you have for us regarding our deposit products?**: 

- As someone who values learning and is always looking to improve my financial situation, I appreciate the opportunity to provide feedback on your deposit products. One suggestion I have is to offer more personalized savings plans or tools that can help customers set and achieve their financial goals. For example, if there were a feature that allowed me to input my savings goals and then provided recommendations on how much to save each month and which accounts to use, that would be a great tool for me to use. Additionally, if there were any educational resources or financial planning tools available through the credit union, that would also be a nice feature.
