[{"What are your short-term financial goals and how do you plan on achieving them?": "My short-term financial goals are to save up for a down payment on a house and to start my own business. To achieve these goals, I am creating a budget and cutting back on unnecessary expenses, as well as exploring funding options for my business idea."}, {"What are your long-term financial goals and how do you plan on achieving them?": "My long-term financial goals are to achieve financial stability and security for my retirement. To achieve this, I plan on making smart investments and saving diligently. I also plan on exploring different retirement savings accounts and options offered by my credit union."}, {"Have you ever considered alternative savings options outside of a traditional savings account? If so, which ones?": "Yes, I have considered alternative savings options such as high-yield savings accounts and money market accounts. I am also interested in exploring certificates of deposit (CDs) and other investment options to maximize my savings and earn higher interest rates."}, {"What financial products or services have you used in the past and what did you like/dislike about them?": "I have used traditional savings accounts and checking accounts in the past. I appreciate the convenience of having a checking account for daily transactions, but I find that the interest rates on savings accounts are too low to make a significant impact on my savings. Additionally, I have had some negative experiences with hidden fees or charges associated with my accounts."}, {"What features or benefits would you prioritize in a new financial product?": "I would prioritize flexibility and accessibility. As someone who is always on-the-go, I need to be able to access my finances from anywhere at any time.

Finally, higher interest rates or other incentives for saving would be a significant benefit for me."}, {"How important is earning interest on your savings to you?": "Earning interest on my savings is very important to me.

While interest rates may not be the only factor in my decision-making process, they certainly play a significant role."}, {"What concerns do you have when it comes to opening a new account with a credit union?": "My biggest concern would be the level of convenience and accessibility. If I can't easily manage my accounts online or through a mobile app, it could be a deal-breaker for me. Additionally, I would want to know that my money is safe and secure with the credit union and that they have a strong track record of protecting their members' funds. Finally, I would be wary of any hidden fees or charges that could eat away at my savings over time."}]
