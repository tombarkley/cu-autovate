[{"What are your short-term financial goals and how do you plan on achieving them?": "My short-term financial goals are to save money for a down payment on a house and to build an emergency fund. I plan on achieving them by creating a budget, reducing unnecessary expenses, and increasing my income through my teaching job and part-time tutoring."}, {"What are your long-term financial goals and how do you plan on achieving them?": "My long-term financial goals are to start a family and provide them with a comfortable life, to save for my retirement, and to pay off any debts. I plan on achieving them by continuing to budget, saving aggressively, investing wisely, and seeking financial advice when necessary."}, {"Have you ever considered alternative savings options outside of a traditional savings account? If so, which ones?": "Yes, I have considered alternative savings options such as high-yield savings accounts, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit (CDs). I have also explored investment options such as mutual funds and stocks, but I prefer to be more risk-averse with my savings."}, {"What financial products or services have you used in the past and what did you like/dislike about them?": "I have used traditional savings accounts, checking accounts, credit cards, and personal loans in the past. I have liked the convenience of online banking and mobile apps that allow me to manage my accounts from anywhere. However, I have disliked high fees, low interest rates, and poor customer service from some financial institutions. I also prefer financial products that offer rewards or cashback incentives."}, {"What features or benefits would you prioritize in a new financial product?": "I would prioritize competitive interest rates, low fees, user-friendly mobile and online banking features, and good customer service. I would also appreciate rewards or cashback incentives for using the product responsibly. Additionally, flexibility in terms of how much to deposit and when to withdraw funds would be important to me."}, {"How important is earning interest on your savings to you?": "Earning interest on my savings is very important to me. I want my money to work for me and grow over time, rather than lose value due to inflation. I also believe that saving money should be incentivized and rewarded, so competitive interest rates are a key factor in choosing a financial product."}, {"What concerns do you have when it comes to opening a new account with a credit union?": "One concern I have is the accessibility of physical branches and ATMs, since I want to be able to easily access my money when I need it. Another concern is the level of trustworthiness and security offered by the credit union. I would also be worried about hidden fees or charges, as well as any potential restrictions on my ability to withdraw or deposit funds. Finally, I would be interested in knowing what other types of financial products and services the credit union offers, such as loans or credit cards."}]
