Additionally, the competitive interest rates and no fees are attractive features that would help me grow my savings without worrying about extra costs."}, {"What concerns do you have about using this product?": "My main concern would be the limitations on the number of withdrawals per month. While I understand the need to limit withdrawals to encourage saving, I also want to make sure that I have access to my funds when I need them. Additionally, I would want to make sure that the mobile and online banking features are user-friendly and secure, as I value convenience but also want to make sure my personal information is protected."}, {"Is there anything missing from this product that would make you more likely to use it?": "One thing that would make me more likely to use this product is the ability to set up automatic transfers from my checking account to the Rainy Day Savings Account.

Additionally, if the credit union offered any incentives or rewards for reaching savings goals, that would be a nice added bonus."}, {"How easy or difficult do you think it would be to use this product?": "Based on the product features and mechanics, I think it would be relatively easy to use this product. The minimum opening deposit of $25 and no minimum balance requirement make it accessible to a wide range of customers, and the flexible deposit and withdrawal options would make it easy to manage my savings.
