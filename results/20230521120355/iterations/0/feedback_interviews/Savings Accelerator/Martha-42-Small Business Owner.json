For example, if there were cash bonuses or discounts on other financial products offered by the credit union. Additionally, it would be helpful if there were resources or educational materials available to help me set and achieve my financial goals."}, {"How easy or difficult do you think it would be to use this product?": "Based on the product description, it seems like the Savings Accelerator would be relatively easy to use. The online and mobile banking tools are described as easy-to-use, and the process of setting financial goals and automatic transfers from my checking account seems straightforward.

For example, some people may be saving for a large purchase like a car or a wedding, while others may be saving for smaller goals like a vacation or a new computer. It would be helpful if the Savings Accelerator allowed users to set and track progress towards a variety of savings goals, rather than just one overarching goal. Additionally, it would be great if the product offered personalized recommendations or tips for achieving savings goals based on the user's spending habits and financial situation."}]
