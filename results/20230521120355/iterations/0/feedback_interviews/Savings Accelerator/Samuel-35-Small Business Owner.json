For example, it would be great if there were discounts on financial planning services or other perks that could help me achieve my financial goals. Additionally, it would be helpful if the product offered personalized financial advice or resources to help me make the most of my savings."}, {"How easy or difficult do you think it would be to use this product?": "Based on the product features and mechanics, I think it would be relatively easy to use this product. The online and mobile banking tools seem user-friendly and the automatic transfers from my checking account would make it easy to stay on track with my savings goals.

Additionally, it would be helpful if the product offered educational resources or personalized advice to help customers make the most of their savings. Finally, it would be great if there were opportunities to earn additional rewards or perks beyond just bonus interest, such as discounts on financial planning services or other incentives that could help customers achieve their financial goals."}]
