[{"What features of this product appeal to you?": "As someone who values flexibility and accessibility, I really like the fact that the Dream Saver Account has flexible terms to accommodate changing financial needs and goals, and that it can be easily accessed through a secure mobile banking app. The fact that there are no monthly maintenance fees or hidden charges is also a big plus for me. And of course, the competitive interest rates are definitely a draw."}, {"What concerns do you have about using this product?": "As someone who values honesty and transparency, I would want to make sure that there are no hidden fees or charges that could catch me off guard. I would also want to make sure that my money is safe and secure, so knowing that the account is FDIC insured up to $250,000 is reassuring. Other than that, I don't really have any concerns about using this product."}, {"Is there anything missing from this product that would make you more likely to use it?": "As someone who is introverted and values privacy, I would appreciate if the product had an option for a joint account with a trusted family member or friend. This would allow me to share the account with someone I trust without having to disclose my personal financial information to them. Other than that, I think the product has all the features I would need to make me more likely to use it."}, {"How easy or difficult do you think it would be to use this product?": "Based on the product features and mechanics, I think the Dream Saver Account would be very easy to use. The fact that it can be accessed through a secure mobile banking app makes it very convenient and accessible, and the lack of hidden fees or charges means that there wouldn't be any surprises or confusion when using the account. The option to set up automatic transfers from a checking account is also a nice touch that would make it even easier to use. Overall, I would rate the ease of use of this product as a 9 out of 10."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to sign up for this product yourself?": "As someone who values flexibility, accessibility, and competitive interest rates, I would rate my likelihood of signing up for the Dream Saver Account as an 8 out of 10. The lack of hidden fees or charges and the fact that the account is FDIC insured up to $250,000 are also big draws for me. The only thing that would make me hesitate is the minimum balance requirement of $500, which might be a bit high for me depending on my current financial situation."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to recommend this product to a friend?": "As someone who values honesty and transparency, and who appreciates the flexibility and accessibility of the Dream Saver Account, I would rate my likelihood of recommending this product to a friend as a 9 out of 10. The competitive interest rates, lack of hidden fees or charges, and easy online access through a secure mobile banking app are all features that I think would appeal to a wide range of people. The only thing that might make me hesitate to recommend it is the minimum balance requirement of $500, which might not be feasible for everyone."}, {"What other suggestions or feedback do you have for improving this product?": "Overall, I think the Dream Saver Account is a great product that has a lot of potential to attract new members to the credit union. However, as someone who values privacy and flexibility, I would suggest adding an option for a joint account with a trusted family member or friend. This would allow people to share the account without having to disclose their personal financial information to someone they don't fully trust. Additionally, I would suggest considering lowering the minimum balance requirement to make the account more accessible to people with lower incomes or who are just starting to save. Finally, I would suggest adding more options for ATM withdrawals, as one free withdrawal per month might not be enough for some people. Overall, I think these changes would make the product even more appealing to a wider range of people."}]
