[{"What features of this product appeal to you?": "As a teacher, I'm always looking for ways to save money and plan for my future. The competitive interest rates that increase based on balance tiers and the option to link the Flex Saver account to my checking account for automatic savings transfers are definitely appealing features. I also appreciate the free financial education resources and personalized financial advice, as it shows that the credit union is invested in helping me reach my financial goals."}, {"What concerns do you have about using this product?": "One concern I have is the penalty for closing the account within the first six months. While I don't anticipate needing to close the account, it's always good to have flexibility and not be penalized for making changes. Additionally, I would like to know more about the mobile banking and ATM access, such as any potential fees or limitations on withdrawals. Overall, I think the product sounds promising, but I would want to make sure I have all the information before opening an account."}, {"Is there anything missing from this product that would make you more likely to use it?": "One thing that would make me more likely to use this product is the ability to set savings goals within the account. For example, if I could set a goal to save for a down payment on a house or a vacation, and track my progress towards that goal within the account, it would be a great motivator for me to continue saving. Additionally, if there were any rewards or incentives for reaching certain savings milestones, that would be a nice added bonus."}, {"How easy or difficult do you think it would be to use this product?": "Based on the product features and mechanics, I think it would be relatively easy to use this product. The ability to set up recurring transfers or make one-time deposits, as well as the easy access to funds through mobile banking and ATMs, make it convenient to save and manage my money. The free financial education resources and personalized financial advice also show that the credit union is invested in helping me make the most of my savings. Overall, I think the product is designed to be user-friendly and accessible."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to sign up for this product yourself?": "As someone who values financial stability and education, and is looking for ways to save for the future, I would rate my likelihood of signing up for this product as an 8. The competitive interest rates, flexible contribution options, and free financial education resources are all appealing features that align with my goals and values. However, I would want to do more research and get more information about the product before making a final decision."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to recommend this product to a friend?": "As someone who values financial stability and education, and is looking for ways to save for the future, I would rate my likelihood of recommending this product to a friend as a 9.

However, I would want to make sure that the product aligns with my friend's specific financial goals and needs before recommending it."}, {"What other suggestions or feedback do you have for improving this product?": "One suggestion I have for improving this product is to offer more customization options for the account. For example, allowing members to choose their own balance tiers and corresponding interest rates, or offering different types of savings accounts with varying features and benefits. Additionally, it would be helpful to have more transparency around any potential fees or limitations on withdrawals, to avoid any surprises or confusion for members. Finally, incorporating gamification elements, such as savings challenges or rewards for hitting certain milestones, could make the savings experience more engaging and motivating for members."}]
