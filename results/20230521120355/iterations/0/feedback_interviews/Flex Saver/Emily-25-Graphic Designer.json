[{"What features of this product appeal to you?": "As a graphic designer, I value flexibility and convenience, so the ability to access my funds easily through mobile banking and ATMs is definitely a plus. I also appreciate the competitive interest rates that increase as my balance grows, as well as the option to link my Flex Saver account to my checking account for automatic savings transfers. And the fact that there are no minimum balance requirements or monthly maintenance fees is a huge bonus."}, {"What concerns do you have about using this product?": "One concern I have is the penalty for closing the account within the first six months. While I don't anticipate needing to close the account early, it's always good to have that flexibility in case of unexpected circumstances. Additionally, I would want to make sure that the financial education resources and personalized advice are actually helpful and relevant to my specific financial goals and situation."}, {"Is there anything missing from this product that would make you more likely to use it?": "One thing that would make me more likely to use this product is if there were rewards or incentives for reaching certain savings milestones. For example, if I could earn bonus interest or cash back for reaching a certain balance or consistently making deposits, that would be a great motivator for me to save even more. Additionally, it would be helpful if there were tools or resources to help me track my progress towards my savings goals and make adjustments as needed."}, {"How easy or difficult do you think it would be to use this product?": "Based on the product features and mechanics, I think it would be very easy to use this product. The ability to access my funds through mobile banking and ATMs, as well as the option to set up recurring transfers or make one-time deposits, makes it very convenient to save. And the fact that there are no minimum balance requirements or monthly maintenance fees means that there are no barriers to entry. Overall, I think this product is designed to be user-friendly and accessible to a wide range of consumers."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to sign up for this product yourself?": "As someone who values flexibility, convenience, and competitive interest rates, I would rate my likelihood of signing up for this product as an 8 out of 10. The ability to access my funds easily through mobile banking and ATMs, as well as the option to link my Flex Saver account to my checking account for automatic savings transfers, is very appealing to me. And the fact that there are no minimum balance requirements or monthly maintenance fees makes it a low-risk option for me to consider. However, I would want to do more research on the financial education resources and personalized advice offered by the credit union before making a final decision."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to recommend this product to a friend?": "As someone who values financial stability and the ability to save for both short-term and long-term goals, I would rate my likelihood of recommending this product to a friend as a 9 out of 10. The competitive interest rates that increase as balance tiers are met, the flexible contribution options, and the easy access to funds through mobile banking and ATMs make it a very attractive option for anyone looking to save money. And the fact that there are no minimum balance requirements or monthly maintenance fees means that it's accessible to a wide range of consumers. The only reason I wouldn't rate it a 10 out of 10 is because I would want to make sure that the financial education resources and personalized advice offered by the credit union are actually helpful and relevant to my friend's specific financial goals and situation."}, {"What other suggestions or feedback do you have for improving this product?": "One suggestion I have for improving this product is to offer more customization options for the interest rate tiers. For example, if I could choose to have a higher interest rate for balances between $10,000 and $15,000, that would give me an added incentive to save even more. Additionally, it would be helpful if there were more transparency around how the interest rates are calculated and how they compare to other savings accounts on the market. Finally, it would be great if there were more opportunities to earn rewards or bonuses for reaching certain savings milestones, as I mentioned earlier. Overall, I think these enhancements would make the product even more appealing to consumers and help differentiate it from other savings accounts on the market."}]
