[{"What features of this product appeal to you?": "As a creative and adventurous person, I really like the idea of personalized savings goals and progress tracking. It would be great to have a clear picture of how much progress I'm making towards my financial goals, like saving for a down payment on a house or starting my own design business. The flexible contribution options are also appealing, as it would allow me to save at my own pace and adjust my contributions as needed. And of course, the competitive interest rates are always a plus!"}, {"What concerns do you have about using this product?": "One concern I have is the potential for hidden fees or minimum balance requirements. As someone who values transparency and authenticity, I want to make sure that I'm not being charged for something without my knowledge. Additionally, while I appreciate the idea of a high-yield savings account, I would want to make sure that the interest rates are truly competitive and not just a temporary promotional rate. Finally, I would want to make sure that the mobile app and online banking are user-friendly and reliable, as I rely heavily on technology for managing my finances."}, {"Is there anything missing from this product that would make you more likely to use it?": "One thing that would make me more likely to use this product is the ability to set up sub-accounts or buckets for different savings goals. For example, if I wanted to save for both a down payment on a house and a trip to Europe, it would be helpful to have separate accounts within SmartSaver to track my progress towards each goal. Additionally, it would be great to have resources or tools within the mobile app or online banking to help me make informed decisions about my savings goals, such as calculators or educational content."}, {"How easy or difficult do you think it would be to use this product?": "Based on the product features and mechanics, I think it would be relatively easy to use SmartSaver. The flexible contribution options and personalized savings goals seem straightforward, and the ability to track progress towards those goals through the mobile app or online banking is a nice touch. However, the ease of use would also depend on the user interface of the mobile app and online banking, as well as the clarity of any terms and conditions associated with the account. Overall, I would say that the product seems user-friendly and accessible."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to sign up for this product yourself?": "As someone who values financial stability and transparency, and who is interested in personalized savings goals and progress tracking, I would say that I am fairly likely to sign up for this product myself. I would rate my likelihood as an 8 out of 10."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to recommend this product to a friend?": "As someone who values transparency, authenticity, and financial stability, and who is interested in personalized savings goals and progress tracking, I would say that I am fairly likely to recommend this product to a friend. I would rate my likelihood as a 7 out of 10."}, {"What other suggestions or feedback do you have for improving this product?": "One suggestion I have for improving this product is to offer additional rewards or incentives for reaching savings goals. For example, if a customer saves a certain amount of money within a certain timeframe, they could receive a bonus interest rate or a cash reward. This could help incentivize customers to save more aggressively and make the product even more appealing. Additionally, it would be helpful to have resources or tools within the mobile app or online banking to help customers make informed decisions about their savings goals, such as calculators or educational content. Finally, it would be great to have the ability to set up sub-accounts or buckets for different savings goals, as I mentioned earlier."}]
