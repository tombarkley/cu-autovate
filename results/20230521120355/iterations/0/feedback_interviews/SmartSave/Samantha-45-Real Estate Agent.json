The ability to set up automatic transfers and choose between a traditional savings account or a high-yield savings account based on my needs would make it easy to get started and customize my savings plan.

For example, if someone is saving for a down payment on a house or planning for retirement, they may have different savings goals and timelines than someone who is saving for a vacation or a new car. Offering more customized savings plans and resources could help members stay on track with their goals and feel more engaged with the product. Additionally, offering more rewards or incentives for reaching certain savings milestones could be a great way to motivate members to save even more."}]
