[{"What features of this product appeal to you?": "As a creative and adventurous person, I'm always looking for ways to achieve my goals faster and more efficiently. The competitive interest rates that are up to 3 times higher than traditional savings accounts definitely caught my attention. I also appreciate the fact that there are no monthly maintenance fees or minimum balance requirements, which makes it easier for me to save without worrying about additional costs. Additionally, the unlimited deposits and withdrawals feature is a big plus, as I like to have access to my money when I need it. Finally, the user-friendly digital tools and resources that help me track my progress and achieve my goals are very appealing."}, {"What concerns do you have about using this product?": "One of my biggest concerns is the minimum deposit requirement of $1,000 to open a Savings Boost Account. As a young graphic designer, I don't always have a lot of extra money to save, so it might be difficult for me to meet that requirement. Another concern is that the interest rates are tiered based on the account balance, so I might not earn as much interest if I don't have a large balance in my account. Finally, while I appreciate the user-friendly digital tools and resources, I would want to make sure that they are secure and that my personal information is protected."}, {"Is there anything missing from this product that would make you more likely to use it?": "One thing that would make me more likely to use this product is if there were more flexibility in the minimum deposit requirement. As a young professional, I don't always have a lot of extra money to save, so it would be great if there were options for lower minimum deposits or if the credit union offered incentives for reaching certain savings milestones. Additionally, it would be helpful if there were more personalized financial advice and resources available to help me achieve my specific goals, such as starting my own design business or saving for a down payment on a house."}, {"How easy or difficult do you think it would be to use this product?": "Based on the product features and mechanics, I think it would be relatively easy to use this product. The fact that there are no monthly maintenance fees or minimum balance requirements, and that deposits and withdrawals are unlimited, makes it simple to manage my savings without worrying about additional costs or restrictions. The user-friendly digital tools and resources also seem like they would be easy to navigate and use. However, the minimum deposit requirement of $1,000 might be a barrier for some people, including myself, and could make it more difficult to use the product."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to sign up for this product yourself?": "As a young professional who values financial stability and wants to achieve my goals faster, I would rate my likelihood of signing up for this product as an 8 out of 10. The competitive interest rates, no fees, and user-friendly digital tools are very appealing to me, and I appreciate the flexibility of unlimited deposits and withdrawals. However, the minimum deposit requirement of $1,000 might be a barrier for me, and I would want to explore other options before committing to this product."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to recommend this product to a friend?": "As someone who values financial stability and wants to help my friends achieve their goals, I would rate my likelihood of recommending this product to a friend as a 7 out of 10. While I think the competitive interest rates, no fees, and user-friendly digital tools are very appealing, the minimum deposit requirement of $1,000 might be a barrier for some of my friends who are just starting to save or who don't have a lot of extra money to put towards savings. However, for those who are able to meet the minimum deposit requirement, I think this product could be a great option for reaching their savings goals faster."}, {"What other suggestions or feedback do you have for improving this product?": "One suggestion I have for improving this product is to offer more flexibility in the minimum deposit requirement. This could include options for lower minimum deposits or incentives for reaching certain savings milestones. Additionally, it would be helpful if there were more personalized financial advice and resources available to help users achieve their specific goals, such as starting a business or saving for a down payment on a house. Finally, it would be great if there were more transparency around the interest rates and how they are calculated, as well as more information about the security of the user's personal information and data."}]
