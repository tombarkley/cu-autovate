While the product advertisement mentions that rewards and incentives are available, it would be helpful to have more information on what those rewards are and how they can be earned. Additionally, it would be helpful if the credit union could offer more flexibility in terms of how members can deposit funds into their account. For example, allowing members to deposit funds through mobile payment apps like Venmo or PayPal would make it easier for individuals who primarily use digital payment methods to save money. Finally, it would be helpful if the credit union could offer more educational resources or workshops on financial literacy and planning, as this would help members make informed decisions about their money and achieve their long-term financial goals."}]
