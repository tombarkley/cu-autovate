[{"What features of this product appeal to you?": "As a software developer who values efficiency, I appreciate the automatic savings tools like round-up transfers and recurring transfers. It's great to be able to save money without having to think about it. The competitive interest rates up to 3% APY are also very attractive to me. And I like that there are no monthly maintenance fees or minimum balance requirements."}, {"What concerns do you have about using this product?": "One concern I have is the requirement to have a checking account with your credit union in order to open an Accelerate Savings Account. I already have a checking account with another bank that I'm happy with, so it would be an inconvenience to have to switch. Additionally, while I appreciate the personalized financial planning and investment guidance, I'm a bit reserved when it comes to sharing my financial information with others. I would need to feel confident in the security measures in place to protect my personal information."}, {"Is there anything missing from this product that would make you more likely to use it?": "One feature that would make me more likely to use this product is the ability to set savings goals and track my progress towards them. It would be helpful to have a visual representation of how much progress I'm making towards my financial goals. Additionally, it would be great to have access to educational resources or workshops on financial literacy and planning. As someone who values learning new skills, having access to these resources would be a big draw for me."}, {"How easy or difficult do you think it would be to use this product?": "Based on the product features and mechanics, I think it would be relatively easy to use this product. The ability to deposit and withdraw funds through various channels (direct deposit, ACH transfer, mobile check deposit, online transfer, wire transfer, or in-person at a branch) is convenient and flexible. The automatic savings tools and personalized financial planning also seem straightforward and user-friendly. Overall, I think the product is designed with ease of use in mind."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to sign up for this product yourself?": "As someone who values competitive interest rates, automatic savings tools, and personalized financial planning, I would rate my likelihood of signing up for this product as an 8 out of 10. The requirement to have a checking account with the credit union is a bit of a drawback for me, but the other features are very appealing."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to recommend this product to a friend?": "As someone who values financial stability and independence, I would rate my likelihood of recommending this product to a friend as a 9 out of 10. The competitive interest rates, automatic savings tools, and personalized financial planning are all features that I think would be attractive to many people. The only drawback is the requirement to have a checking account with the credit union, but overall I think it's a strong product that could benefit a lot of people."}, {"What other suggestions or feedback do you have for improving this product?": "One suggestion I have for improving this product is to offer more flexibility in terms of the checking account requirement. For example, perhaps members could have the option to link an external checking account instead of having to open a new one with the credit union. Additionally, as I mentioned earlier, the ability to set savings goals and track progress towards them would be a valuable feature. Finally, offering educational resources or workshops on financial literacy and planning would be a great way to attract members who are looking to learn more about managing their finances."}]
