Additionally, it would be helpful if the credit union offered more transparency around the interest rates and fees associated with the account, as this could help customers make more informed decisions about their savings strategy. Finally, it would be great if the credit union offered more opportunities for community engagement and social impact, such as partnering with local non-profits or offering volunteer opportunities for customers. This could help differentiate the credit union from other financial institutions and attract customers who value social responsibility and community involvement."}]
