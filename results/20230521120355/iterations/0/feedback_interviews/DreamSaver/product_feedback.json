While the financial education resources and tools are a great start, some customers may benefit from more one-on-one support and guidance in order to make informed decisions about their finances. Additionally, it would be helpful if the credit union offered more transparency around the interest rates and fees associated with the account, as this could help customers make more informed decisions about their savings strategy. Finally, it would be great if the credit union offered more opportunities for community engagement and social impact, such as partnering with local non-profits or offering volunteer opportunities for customers. This could help differentiate the credit union from other financial institutions and attract customers who value social responsibility and community involvement.", "One suggestion I have for improving this product is to offer more personalized financial advice or guidance. As a small business owner, I have unique financial needs and goals that may not be addressed by general financial education resources. It would be helpful if there were more tailored advice or recommendations based on my specific financial situation and goals. Additionally, it would be great if there were more options for customizing the account features, such as the ability to choose from different types of investment options or to set up joint accounts with family members or business partners."]}]}
