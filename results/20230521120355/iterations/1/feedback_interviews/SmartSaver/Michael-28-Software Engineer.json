[{"What do you think of our new deposit product?": "As a software engineer who values financial stability, I think SmartSaver sounds like an interesting product. The personalized savings goals and progress tracking feature seems like it would be really helpful for people who are trying to save for specific things like a down payment on a house or paying off student loans. The competitive interest rates are also a big plus. However, I would like to know more about the mechanics of how the interest rate increases as customers reach their savings goals."}, {"What features of the product would make you consider using it?": "The flexibility of the contribution options and the ability to set up automatic contributions from my paycheck or other accounts are definitely features that would make me consider using SmartSaver. I also appreciate that there are no monthly fees or minimum balance requirements. The personalized savings goals and progress tracking feature is also really appealing to me, as it would help me stay motivated and on track towards achieving my financial goals."}, {"Is there anything missing from the product that would make you more likely to use it?": "As someone who values independence, I would appreciate more control over how my money is invested. It would be great if SmartSaver offered options for investing in socially responsible or sustainable funds. Additionally, it would be helpful to have more information about the interest rate increases as customers reach their savings goals. How much does the interest rate increase? Is there a cap on how high the interest rate can go? Having more transparency around this would make me more likely to use the product."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to open a deposit account with us?": "As someone who values financial stability and is interested in the features of SmartSaver, I would rate my likelihood of opening a deposit account with your credit union at an 8 out of 10."}, {"What factors are most important to you when choosing where to open a deposit account?": "For me, the most important factors when choosing where to open a deposit account are competitive interest rates, low fees, and convenience. I want to make sure that my money is earning as much interest as possible, while also avoiding unnecessary fees. Convenience is also important to me, as I want to be able to access my account easily and manage my finances on-the-go. Trustworthiness and good customer service are also important factors for me when choosing a financial institution."}, {"What are some concerns you have about opening a deposit account with us?": "As someone who values transparency and independence, my main concern would be around the mechanics of how the interest rate increases as customers reach their savings goals.

Finally, I would want to make sure that your credit union has a good reputation for trustworthiness and customer service."}, {"What types of rewards or incentives would make you more likely to open a deposit account with us?": "As someone who is motivated by financial stability and achieving my goals, rewards or incentives that would make me more likely to open a deposit account with your credit union would be things like bonus interest rates for reaching certain savings milestones, cashback rewards for using my debit card, or discounts on other financial products like loans or mortgages. Additionally, if your credit union offered educational resources or financial planning tools to help me achieve my goals, that would also be a valuable incentive for me."}, {"What other feedback do you have for us regarding our deposit products?": "As someone who is interested in financial stability and achieving my goals, I appreciate the features of SmartSaver and think it could be a valuable product for your credit union to offer. However, I would also be interested in seeing other deposit products that offer more flexibility and customization options. For example, a product that allows me to choose which funds my money is invested in or offers more options for setting savings goals would be appealing to me. Additionally, I would appreciate more transparency around fees and interest rates, as well as more educational resources to help me make informed decisions about my finances. Overall, I think your credit union has the potential to offer innovative and valuable deposit products, and I look forward to seeing what you come up with in the future."}]
