However, one suggestion I would make is to consider offering additional customization options for savings goals. For example, if there were options to save for specific events or expenses, such as a child's college tuition or a family vacation, that would be really helpful. Additionally, it would be great if there were options to set up joint accounts or sub-accounts for different savings goals, so that families or couples could save together more easily. Finally, I would appreciate more transparency around the fees and charges associated with the account, so that I can make an informed decision about whether it is the right fit for me."}]
