Being able to set specific goals and track my progress towards them would help me stay motivated and on track with my savings. I also like the idea of having flexible contribution options, as it would allow me to save in a way that works best for my business and personal finances. And of course, the competitive interest rates are always a plus!"}, {"Is there anything missing from the product that would make you more likely to use it?": "One thing that would make me more likely to use the product is if there were incentives or rewards for reaching savings goals. For example, if I could earn bonus interest or cash back for hitting certain milestones, that would be a great motivator for me to save even more. Additionally, it would be helpful if there were more options for linking external accounts, such as investment accounts or retirement funds, to the DreamSaver account. That way, I could easily transfer money between accounts and manage my finances more efficiently."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to open a deposit account with us?": "As someone who is always looking for ways to save and grow my money, and who values financial education and resources, I would rate my likelihood of opening a deposit account with your credit union at an 8 out of 10. The DreamSaver product sounds like it could be a great fit for my needs and goals, and I appreciate the flexibility and customization options it offers. However, I would need to do more research and compare it to other options before making a final decision."}, {"What factors are most important to you when choosing where to open a deposit account?": "As a small business owner, there are several factors that are important to me when choosing where to open a deposit account. First and foremost, I look for competitive interest rates and low fees, as these can have a big impact on my bottom line. I also value convenience and accessibility, so having online banking and mobile app options is a must. Additionally, I want to feel like my money is safe and secure, so I look for institutions with a strong reputation and good customer service. Finally, I appreciate resources and tools that can help me make informed financial decisions and achieve my goals, such as financial education and planning services."}, {"What are some concerns you have about opening a deposit account with us?": "As someone who values financial stability and security, one concern I might have about opening a deposit account with your credit union is the level of insurance protection provided by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). While I understand that NCUA insurance is similar to FDIC insurance for banks, I would want to make sure that my deposits are fully insured and protected in the unlikely event of a financial crisis or failure. Additionally, I would want to know more about the fees and charges associated with the DreamSaver product, as well as any potential penalties for early withdrawals or account closures. Finally, I would want to make sure that the credit union has a strong track record of customer service and support, and that I would have access to the resources and tools I need to manage my account effectively."}, {"What types of rewards or incentives would make you more likely to open a deposit account with us?": "As a small business owner, I am always looking for ways to save and grow my money, so any rewards or incentives that could help me achieve my financial goals would be appealing. For example, if there were bonus interest rates or cash back rewards for reaching certain savings milestones, that would be a great motivator for me to save even more. Additionally, if there were discounts or special offers on other financial products or services, such as loans or credit cards, that could also be a compelling incentive. Finally, if there were opportunities to earn points or rewards for using my debit card or other banking services, that could be a fun and engaging way to encourage me to use the account more frequently."}, {"What other feedback do you have for us regarding our deposit products?": "Overall, I think the DreamSaver product sounds like a great option for people who are looking to save and achieve their financial goals. However, I would suggest considering some additional features or benefits that could make the product even more appealing to potential customers. For example, it might be helpful to offer personalized financial planning or coaching services to help customers set and achieve their savings goals. Additionally, it could be useful to provide educational resources and tools that can help customers make informed decisions about their finances, such as budgeting calculators or retirement planning guides. Finally, it might be worth exploring partnerships with other businesses or organizations that align with your credit union's values and mission, such as local charities or community development organizations, to offer additional benefits or incentives to customers who support these causes."}]
