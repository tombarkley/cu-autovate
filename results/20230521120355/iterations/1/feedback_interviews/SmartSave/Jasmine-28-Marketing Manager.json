For example, if the credit union offered a cash bonus for reaching certain savings milestones or a higher interest rate for maintaining a certain balance in my account, that would be a great motivator for me to use the SmartSave product even more. Additionally, if there were any discounts or special offers available to credit union members for other financial products or services, that would also be a nice perk."}, {"What other feedback do you have for us regarding our deposit products?": "Overall, I think the SmartSave product is a great addition to your deposit products. It seems like a convenient and innovative way to help members achieve their financial goals while earning competitive interest rates.

Additionally, it would be helpful if the credit union could provide more educational resources on financial literacy and money management to help members make informed decisions about their finances."}]
