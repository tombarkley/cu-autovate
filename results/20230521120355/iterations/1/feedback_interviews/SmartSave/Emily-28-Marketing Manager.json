One suggestion I have for improving the product would be to offer more flexibility in terms of the types of accounts that are available. For example, some people might prefer a money market account or a certificate of deposit (CD) over a traditional savings account or high-yield savings account. Additionally, it might be helpful to offer more guidance or resources for people who are just starting out with saving and may not know where to begin. This could include things like budgeting tools, financial planning sessions, or educational resources on topics like investing and retirement planning. Finally, it would be great if there were more opportunities to earn rewards or discounts on other financial products or services offered by the credit union, as this would incentivize me to use more of your products and services."}]
