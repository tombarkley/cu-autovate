For example, if you offered a bonus interest rate for reaching a certain savings threshold, or a cash bonus for opening a new account and meeting certain deposit requirements, that would definitely catch my attention. Additionally, if you offered any other perks or benefits for being a member of the credit union, such as discounts on loans or access to exclusive events or services, that would also be a nice added bonus."}, {"What other feedback do you have for us regarding our deposit products?": "Overall, I think your deposit products are very competitive and offer a lot of value to potential customers. However, as I mentioned earlier, having a mobile app would be a great addition to your digital tools and resources, as it would make it easier for customers to manage their accounts on-the-go. Additionally, I think it would be helpful if you offered more educational resources or workshops to help customers learn about personal finance and develop good savings habits. This could include things like budgeting tips, debt management strategies, and retirement planning advice. Finally, I think it would be helpful if you offered more flexibility in terms of account requirements and minimum balances, as this could make your products more accessible to a wider range of customers."}]
