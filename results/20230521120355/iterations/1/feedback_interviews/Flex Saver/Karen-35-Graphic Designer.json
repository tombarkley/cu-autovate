[{"What do you think of our new deposit product?": "Hi there! I'm Karen, a graphic designer from St. Paul. I think your new deposit product, Flex Saver, sounds really interesting. As someone who values financial stability and has a few savings goals in mind, I appreciate the competitive interest rates and the ability to track my progress towards my goals. The fact that there are no minimum balance requirements or monthly maintenance fees is also a big plus for me. Overall, it seems like a hassle-free way to save and reach my financial goals."}, {"What features of the product would make you consider using it?": "There are several features of Flex Saver that would make me consider using it. Firstly, the competitive interest rates that increase as balance tiers are met are very appealing. I also like the fact that there are no minimum balance requirements or monthly maintenance fees, which makes it more accessible for people like me who may not have a lot of money to save initially. The ability to set savings goals and track my progress within the account is also a great feature, as it would help me stay motivated and on track towards achieving my financial goals. Lastly, the rewards and incentives for reaching savings milestones are a nice bonus and would make me feel like I'm being rewarded for my efforts."}, {"Is there anything missing from the product that would make you more likely to use it?": "As someone who is creative and values authenticity, I think it would be great if Flex Saver offered more customization options for setting savings goals. For example, being able to upload a photo or choose a color scheme for each goal would make the experience more personalized and engaging. Additionally, as someone who enjoys hiking and being outdoors, I think it would be cool if there were some sort of eco-friendly or sustainability aspect to the product, such as donating a portion of the interest earned to environmental causes. Overall though, I think the product is very strong and these are just minor suggestions for improvement."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to open a deposit account with us?": "As someone who is looking to start her own design business and values financial stability, I would say I am a 9 out of 10 likely to open a deposit account with your credit union. The features of Flex Saver that you've described align well with my financial goals and the fact that there are no minimum balance requirements or monthly maintenance fees makes it more accessible for me. The only reason I wouldn't give it a 10 out of 10 is because I would want to do some more research and compare it to other options before making a final decision."}, {"What factors are most important to you when choosing where to open a deposit account?": "When choosing where to open a deposit account, there are several factors that are important to me. Firstly, I look for competitive interest rates and low fees, as I want to make sure my money is working for me and not being eaten up by unnecessary charges. Secondly, I value convenience and accessibility, so having easy access to my funds through mobile banking and ATMs is important. Thirdly, I look for a financial institution that offers good customer service and personalized advice, as I want to feel like my needs are being heard and addressed. Lastly, I consider the reputation and values of the institution, as I want to make sure my money is being invested in a responsible and ethical way."}, {"What are some concerns you have about opening a deposit account with us?": "As someone who is considering opening a deposit account with your credit union, I don't have any major concerns at this time. However, as with any financial decision, I would want to make sure that I fully understand the terms and conditions of the account and any associated fees or penalties. I would also want to make sure that the credit union is insured by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) to ensure my deposits are protected. Lastly, I would want to make sure that the credit union has a good reputation for customer service and financial stability."}, {"What types of rewards or incentives would make you more likely to open a deposit account with us?": "As someone who is motivated by financial stability and making a difference, I think rewards or incentives that align with those values would be most appealing to me. For example, offering a bonus interest rate for the first few months of the account opening would be a nice incentive. Additionally, offering the option to donate rewards or incentives to a charity of my choice would make me feel like I'm making a positive impact beyond just my own financial goals. Lastly, offering financial education resources or personalized advice as a reward or incentive would be very valuable to me, as it would help me make informed decisions about my finances and work towards achieving my goals."}, {"What other feedback do you have for us regarding our deposit products?": "Overall, I think your deposit products are very strong and offer a lot of value to potential customers. One suggestion I have would be to consider offering more flexible contribution options, such as the ability to make deposits through mobile check deposit or by linking external accounts. Additionally, as someone who values creativity and authenticity, I think it would be great if there were more opportunities for customers to customize their account experience, such as choosing a unique account nickname or customizing the account dashboard. Lastly, I think it would be helpful if there were more resources available for small business owners, such as business savings accounts or loans specifically designed for entrepreneurs."}]
