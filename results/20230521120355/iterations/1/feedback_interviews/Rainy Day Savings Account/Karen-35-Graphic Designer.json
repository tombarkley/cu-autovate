Additionally, as someone who is looking to start my own business, I would appreciate if the credit union offered additional products or services that can help me achieve my financial goals, such as business loans or financial planning advice. Finally, I think it would be helpful if the credit union could provide educational resources or workshops on topics such as budgeting, saving, and investing, so that I can continue to improve my financial literacy."}]
