Additionally, any exclusive discounts or perks for credit union members, such as discounted rates on loans or access to financial planning services, would be appealing to me."}, {"What other feedback do you have for us regarding our deposit products?": "Overall, I think that FlexiSave is a promising product that could appeal to a wide range of consumers. However, I would suggest that the credit union consider offering more educational resources or tools to help members achieve their financial goals. For example, providing access to financial planning services or offering online resources on topics such as budgeting, saving for retirement, or managing debt could be helpful for members who are looking to improve their financial literacy. Additionally, I would suggest that the credit union consider offering more personalized support or guidance to members who may be struggling to save or manage their finances. Overall, I think that these types of value-added services could help differentiate FlexiSave from other savings options and attract more members to the credit union."}]
