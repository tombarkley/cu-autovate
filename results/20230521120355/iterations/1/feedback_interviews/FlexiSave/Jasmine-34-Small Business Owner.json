Fees: If there are hidden fees or unexpected charges associated with the account, it could be frustrating and erode my trust in the institution.\n\n3. Security: If there have been any recent security breaches or if your credit union has a history of security issues, I might be hesitant to trust you with my money.\n\n4. Customer service: If I have a problem or question, I want to be able to get in touch with someone quickly and easily. If your customer service is slow or unresponsive, it could be a red flag for me."}, {"What types of rewards or incentives would make you more likely to open a deposit account with us?": "As a consumer, I would be more likely to open a deposit account with your credit union if there were rewards or incentives for reaching savings milestones. For example, if you offered cash bonuses or interest rate boosts for reaching certain savings goals, that would be a nice motivator to keep me on track with my savings. Additionally, if you offered any perks or discounts for being a member of the credit union, such as discounted loan rates or free financial planning services, that would be a valuable addition to the product. Finally, if you had any referral programs that rewarded me for referring friends or family to the credit union, that would be a nice bonus as well."}, {"What other feedback do you have for us regarding our deposit products?": "One piece of feedback I have for your credit union regarding your deposit products is to make sure that you are transparent about your fees and charges. As a consumer, I want to know exactly what I'm getting into when I open an account, so it's important that you are upfront about any fees or charges associated with the account. Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could provide more information about your customer service policies and procedures. If I have a problem or question, I want to be able to get in touch with someone quickly and easily, so it would be helpful to know what channels are available for customer support and how quickly I can expect a response. Finally, I would encourage your credit union to continue to innovate and offer new and exciting products that meet the evolving needs of consumers like me."}]
