I like that I can earn more interest than I would with a traditional savings account, and that I can adjust the terms to fit my changing financial needs and goals.

However, I would suggest considering some additional features that could help differentiate your products from others in the market. For example, offering a mobile app that allows customers to easily track their savings progress and set savings goals would be a great value-add. Additionally, offering more options for fee-free ATM withdrawals or partnering with other banks or credit unions to expand the ATM network would be helpful.\n\nFinally, I would suggest considering some type of financial wellness program that helps customers better understand personal finance and make more informed decisions. This could include things like webinars, workshops, or one-on-one consultations with financial advisors. By offering these types of resources, you could differentiate yourselves as a credit union that truly cares about its customers' financial well-being."}]
