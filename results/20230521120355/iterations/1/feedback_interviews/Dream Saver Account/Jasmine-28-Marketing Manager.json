[{"What do you think of our new deposit product?": "As a marketing manager, I think the Dream Saver Account sounds like a great product! The competitive interest rates and flexible terms are definitely appealing, and the fact that there are no hidden fees is a huge plus. I also appreciate the easy online access through your mobile banking app. Overall, it seems like a convenient and effective way to save for both short-term and long-term goals."}, {"What features of the product would make you consider using it?": "The competitive interest rates are definitely a big draw for me, as well as the flexibility in terms of changing financial needs and goals. I also like the fact that there are no monthly maintenance fees or hidden charges, and that the account is FDIC insured up to $250,000. The option to set up automatic transfers from my checking account is also a convenient feature that would make it easier for me to save consistently."}, {"Is there anything missing from the product that would make you more likely to use it?": "As someone who values convenience, I think it would be helpful to have more than one free ATM withdrawal per month. Additionally, while the minimum balance requirement of $500 is reasonable, it might be nice to have a lower minimum balance option for those who are just starting to save or who may not have as much disposable income. Overall though, I think the product is well-rounded and has a lot of great features that would make it appealing to many people."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to open a deposit account with us?": "As someone who is always looking for ways to save and earn interest on my money, I would say I am a 9 out of 10 likely to open a deposit account with your credit union. The Dream Saver Account sounds like a great option that would help me achieve my financial goals while still providing the convenience and accessibility I need in a savings account."}, {"What factors are most important to you when choosing where to open a deposit account?": "For me, the most important factors when choosing where to open a deposit account are competitive interest rates, low fees, convenience, and security. I want to make sure that my money is earning as much interest as possible, while also being easily accessible and not subject to hidden fees or charges. Additionally, I want to feel confident that my money is safe and secure, which is why FDIC insurance is important to me. Overall, I think the Dream Saver Account checks off all of these boxes and would be a great option for me."}, {"What are some concerns you have about opening a deposit account with us?": "As someone who is always cautious when it comes to finances, my main concern would be the security of my personal and financial information. I would want to make sure that your credit union has strong security measures in place to protect against fraud and identity theft. Additionally, I would want to make sure that there are no hidden fees or charges that could eat into my savings over time. Finally, I would want to make sure that the customer service is responsive and helpful in case I have any questions or concerns about my account."}, {"What types of rewards or incentives would make you more likely to open a deposit account with us?": "While rewards and incentives are always nice, they are not the main factor that would make me more likely to open a deposit account with your credit union. That being said, if you were to offer a sign-up bonus or a higher interest rate for the first few months, that could be a nice added incentive that would make me more likely to choose your credit union over others. Additionally, if you were to offer referral bonuses or other rewards for bringing in new members, that could be a great way to incentivize me to spread the word about your credit union to my friends and family."}, {"What other feedback do you have for us regarding our deposit products?": "One suggestion I have would be to offer more options for automatic savings. For example, if you were to offer a feature where customers could round up their purchases to the nearest dollar and automatically deposit the difference into their savings account, that could be a great way to help people save without even thinking about it. Additionally, if you were to offer tools or resources to help customers set and track their financial goals, that could be a great way to differentiate your credit union from others and provide added value to your customers. Finally, I would suggest offering more flexibility in terms of account types and features, so that customers can choose the account that best meets their individual needs and preferences."}]
