It would also be great to have some sort of rewards or incentives for meeting savings milestones, as this would motivate me to save even more. Additionally, while the customizable sub-accounts are a nice feature, it would be even better if there were more options for organizing and categorizing my savings. Overall, these are just minor suggestions, and I still think the product is very appealing as it is."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to open a deposit account with us?": "As someone who is always looking for ways to make my money work harder for me, I would rate my likelihood of opening a deposit account with your credit union at an 8 out of 10.

Competitive interest rates and low fees are also important to me, as I want to make sure that my money is working as hard as possible for me. Additionally, I value convenience and accessibility, so having easy access to online and mobile banking is a must. Finally, I also consider the reputation and customer service of the institution, as I want to make sure that I am working with a trustworthy and reliable organization."}, {"What are some concerns you have about opening a deposit account with us?": "As someone who values financial security, my biggest concern would be the safety and stability of the institution.

For example, receiving a bonus interest rate or cash bonus for reaching a certain savings goal would be a great motivator. Additionally, rewards or incentives that are tied to referrals could also be effective, as I am always looking for ways to earn more money and help my friends and family do the same. Finally, exclusive discounts or offers on other financial products or services could also be a nice added bonus."}, {"What other feedback do you have for us regarding our deposit products?": "Overall, I think your deposit products are very competitive and appealing. However, one suggestion I have is to offer more flexibility and customization in terms of sub-accounts. For example, allowing customers to create sub-accounts for specific savings goals or categories (e.g. emergency fund, vacation fund, down payment fund) would be very helpful in organizing and tracking their savings progress. Additionally, offering more options for automatic savings tools, such as the ability to set up recurring transfers on a weekly or bi-weekly basis, would be a nice added feature. Finally, I think it would be helpful to offer more educational resources and tools to help customers better understand their finances and make informed decisions about their savings and investments."}]
