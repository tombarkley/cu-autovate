[{"What do you think of our new deposit product?": "As a nurse, I value financial stability and saving for the future. The Accelerate Savings Account sounds like a great option for me to save money and earn competitive interest rates. I also appreciate the automatic savings tools and personalized financial planning guidance. It seems like a convenient and efficient way to manage my finances."}, {"What features of the product would make you consider using it?": "The competitive interest rates up to 3% APY, the automatic savings tools like round-up transfers and recurring transfers, and the personalized financial planning and investment guidance from certified professionals are the features that would make me consider using the Accelerate Savings Account. I also like that there are no monthly maintenance fees or minimum balance requirements, and that I can have unlimited deposits and withdrawals."}, {"Is there anything missing from the product that would make you more likely to use it?": "As someone who values honesty, I would appreciate transparency around any potential fees or penalties associated with the account. It would also be helpful to have more information about the rewards and incentives for meeting savings milestones, such as what those milestones are and what the rewards entail. Overall, though, the product seems comprehensive and appealing."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to open a deposit account with us?": "As someone who values financial stability and saving for the future, I would rate my likelihood of opening a deposit account with your credit union at an 8 out of 10. The features of the Accelerate Savings Account are very appealing to me, and I appreciate the emphasis on personalized financial planning and investment guidance. However, I would need to do more research and compare the account to other options before making a final decision."}, {"What factors are most important to you when choosing where to open a deposit account?": "The most important factors to me when choosing where to open a deposit account are competitive interest rates, low fees, convenience, and trustworthy customer service. I want to earn the most interest possible on my savings, without being charged excessive fees or having to maintain a high minimum balance. I also value convenience, such as online and mobile banking options, and reliable customer service that I can trust to answer any questions or concerns I may have."}, {"What are some concerns you have about opening a deposit account with us?": "As someone who is new to the area, I would want to make sure that your credit union has a strong reputation and is well-established in the community. I would also want to ensure that there are no hidden fees or penalties associated with the account, and that the interest rates and rewards are as advertised. Finally, I would want to make sure that the online and mobile banking platforms are user-friendly and secure."}, {"What types of rewards or incentives would make you more likely to open a deposit account with us?": "As someone who is motivated by helping people and making a difference, I would be more likely to open a deposit account with your credit union if there were rewards or incentives that aligned with those values. For example, if a portion of the interest earned on my savings was donated to a local charity or community organization, that would be very appealing to me. I would also appreciate rewards or incentives that helped me achieve my personal financial goals, such as a bonus for reaching a certain savings milestone or a discount on financial planning services."}, {"What other feedback do you have for us regarding our deposit products?": "One suggestion I have for your credit union is to consider offering more customizable options for deposit accounts. For example, if I wanted to save for a specific goal, such as a down payment on a house or a vacation, it would be helpful to have a sub-account specifically designated for that purpose. Additionally, it would be great if there were more options for automatic savings tools, such as the ability to set up recurring transfers on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. Finally, I would appreciate more transparency around the process for opening and managing deposit accounts, such as clear instructions for setting up online and mobile banking and accessing customer service."}]
