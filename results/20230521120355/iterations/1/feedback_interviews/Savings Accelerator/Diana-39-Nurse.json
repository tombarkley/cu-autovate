Additionally, I would appreciate more transparency around the terms and conditions of the Savings Accelerator product, including any potential fees or penalties for early withdrawals or missed savings milestones. Finally, I would encourage your credit union to continue to prioritize customer service and accessibility, such as by offering easy-to-use online and mobile banking tools and a wide network of ATMs."}]
