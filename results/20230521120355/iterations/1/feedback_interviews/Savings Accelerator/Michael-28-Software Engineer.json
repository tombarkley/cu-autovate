For example, offering a higher bonus interest rate for reaching savings milestones or providing access to financial education resources or tools that help me make informed decisions about my savings goals would be very appealing to me. Additionally, offering sign-up bonuses or waiving fees for new members could be a good way to incentivize me to open a deposit account with your credit union."}, {"What other feedback do you have for us regarding our deposit products?": "One suggestion I have for your credit union regarding your deposit products is to offer more flexibility in terms of account options. For example, some people may prefer a savings account with a higher interest rate but are willing to maintain a higher minimum balance, while others may prefer a savings account with a lower interest rate but no minimum balance requirement. Offering a range of account options that cater to different needs and preferences could be a good way to attract a wider range of customers. Additionally, providing more information about the benefits and features of your deposit products, such as the Savings Accelerator, could help potential customers make more informed decisions about which account is best for them."}]
