I also like the idea of automated savings plans and savings challenges and rewards, as they can help me stay motivated and on track towards achieving my financial goals."}, {"What questions do you have about this new deposit product?": "I'm curious about the specific savings challenges and rewards that are offered with the Dream Saver Account. Can you give me some examples of what those might be? Also, I'm wondering if there are any fees associated with opening or maintaining this account, and if there are any penalties for withdrawing funds before the end of the term. Finally, I'd like to know more about the interest rate and how it compares to other savings accounts on the market."}, {"How likely are you to open a deposit account with our credit union if this new product were available?": "As an intellectual and introspective person, I would need to do more research and compare the Dream Saver Account to other savings accounts on the market before making a decision. However, based on the features and benefits that have been presented to me, I would say I am moderately likely to open a deposit account with your credit union if this new product were available. On a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate my likelihood as a 6."}, {"What would make you more likely to use this new deposit product?": "If the interest rate offered by the Dream Saver Account is competitive and higher than what other banks and credit unions are offering, that would definitely make me more likely to use this new deposit product. Additionally, if there are no fees associated with opening or maintaining the account, and if the savings challenges and rewards are meaningful and achievable, that would also increase my likelihood of using this product. Finally, if the financial education resources provided by your credit union are high-quality and tailored to my specific needs and goals, that would be another factor that would make me more likely to use this product."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how important are competitive interest rates to you when considering a new deposit account?": "As someone who is focused on saving for retirement and leaving behind a positive legacy, competitive interest rates are very important to me. On a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate the importance of competitive interest rates as a 9."}, {"Would you be willing to commit to a certain time period (e.g. 12 months) in exchange for a higher interest rate on this new deposit product?": "As someone who values flexibility and the ability to adapt to changing circumstances, I would prefer not to commit to a specific time period in exchange for a higher interest rate on this new deposit product. However, if the interest rate increase is significant and the terms of the commitment are reasonable, I would be willing to consider it. Ultimately, it would depend on the specific details of the offer and how it fits into my overall financial plan and goals."}, {"What other feedback do you have on this new deposit product?": "Overall, I think the Dream Saver Account is a promising new deposit product that has the potential to attract new members and help existing members achieve their financial goals. I appreciate the flexibility and customization options that are available, as well as the savings challenges and rewards that can help motivate and incentivize members to save more. Additionally, the financial education resources are a valuable feature that can help members make informed decisions about their finances and achieve their goals with confidence. \n\nOne suggestion I have for improvement is to provide more transparency around the interest rate and how it is calculated. It would be helpful to know if there are any tiered interest rates based on the amount of savings, and if there are any limitations or restrictions on earning interest. Additionally, it would be great to see more information about the specific savings challenges and rewards that are available, and how they can be customized to meet individual member needs and goals. Finally, I would appreciate more information about the penalties and fees associated with withdrawing funds before the end of the term, as well as any limitations on the number of withdrawals allowed per year."}]
