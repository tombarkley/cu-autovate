[{"What features of this new deposit product interest you the most?": "As a marketing manager and someone who values financial education, I am particularly interested in the savings challenges and rewards and the financial education resources. I think these features will not only help me stay motivated to save but also provide me with the knowledge and tools I need to make informed decisions about my finances. The flexible terms and competitive interest rate are also appealing as they give me more control over my savings and help me earn more on my deposits."}, {"What questions do you have about this new deposit product?": "I have a few questions about the Dream Saver Account. First, what is the minimum balance required to maintain the account? Second, are there any fees associated with the account? Third, how long is the term for this account? Fourth, how often can I withdraw funds penalty-free? Finally, are there any limitations on the savings challenges and rewards?"}, {"How likely are you to open a deposit account with our credit union if this new product were available?": "As someone who is always looking for ways to save and achieve my financial goals, I would rate my likelihood of opening a deposit account with your credit union at an 8 out of 10. The Dream Saver Account seems like a great option for me, and I appreciate the unique features and benefits it offers. However, I would need to compare it to other savings accounts on the market and ensure that it aligns with my financial needs and goals before making a final decision."}, {"What would make you more likely to use this new deposit product?": "To make me more likely to use this new deposit product, I would appreciate if the credit union could offer a sign-up bonus or waive any fees associated with the account for the first few months. Additionally, if the credit union could provide personalized advice or guidance on how to best utilize the account to achieve my specific financial goals, that would be a huge plus. Finally, if the credit union could offer competitive interest rates and flexible terms that align with my needs, that would make me more likely to use this new deposit product."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how important are competitive interest rates to you when considering a new deposit account?": "I would rate competitive interest rates as a 9 out of 10 when considering a new deposit account. As someone who is looking to save and grow my money, earning a competitive interest rate is crucial to me. I want to ensure that my deposits are working hard for me and helping me achieve my financial goals as quickly as possible. However, I also value other features such as flexibility, convenience, and financial education, so a balance of these factors is important to me when choosing a deposit account."}, {"Would you be willing to commit to a certain time period (e.g. 12 months) in exchange for a higher interest rate on this new deposit product?": "Yes, I would be willing to commit to a certain time period in exchange for a higher interest rate on this new deposit product. If the credit union could offer a higher interest rate for a longer-term commitment, such as 12 months or more, that would be a great incentive for me to save and stay committed to my financial goals.

I appreciate the flexibility and convenience of the account, as well as the savings challenges and rewards that could help keep me motivated and on track. Additionally, the financial education resources are a great added value that could help me make informed decisions about my finances.\n\nOne piece of feedback I have is that it would be helpful to have more information about the savings challenges and rewards upfront, such as what specific milestones or amounts I need to save to earn bonus interest. Additionally, it would be helpful to have more information about the financial education resources, such as what topics are covered and how I can access them.\n\nOverall, I think the Dream Saver Account has a lot of potential and I would definitely consider opening an account if it aligns with my financial needs and goals."}]
