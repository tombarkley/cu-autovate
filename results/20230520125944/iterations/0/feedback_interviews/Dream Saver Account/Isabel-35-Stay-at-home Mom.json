A higher interest rate can help me reach my savings goals faster and earn more money on my deposits over time."}, {"Would you be willing to commit to a certain time period (e.g. 12 months) in exchange for a higher interest rate on this new deposit product?": "Committing to a certain time period in exchange for a higher interest rate is definitely something I would consider. It would depend on the specific terms and conditions of the account, such as the penalty for early withdrawal and the flexibility to change my savings plan if my circumstances change. However, if the terms are reasonable and the interest rate is significantly higher than other options, I would be open to committing to a certain time period to maximize my savings."}, {"What other feedback do you have on this new deposit product?": "Overall, I think the Dream Saver Account is a great concept that aligns with my values and goals. I appreciate the emphasis on financial education resources and personalized savings challenges to help me stay motivated and on track towards my goals. However, I would like to see more transparency around the fees associated with the account, as well as the specific interest rates for different savings goals and time periods. Additionally, it would be helpful to have a mobile app or online platform to easily track my progress and manage my account. Overall, I think this product has a lot of potential and I would definitely consider opening a Dream Saver Account with your credit union if the terms and features align with my needs."}]
