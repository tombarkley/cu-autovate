[{"What features of this new deposit product interest you the most?": "As a stay-at-home mom, I am always looking for ways to save money and plan for the future. The automated savings plans and savings challenges and rewards are particularly appealing to me. It would be great to have a tool that helps me stay motivated and on track towards achieving my financial goals. Additionally, the financial education resources are a nice touch as it can be difficult to navigate the world of personal finance on your own."}, {"What questions do you have about this new deposit product?": "I'm curious about the minimum deposit required to open the Dream Saver Account. Also, what are the penalties for withdrawing funds before the end of the term? Finally, are there any limitations on the types of savings goals I can set?"}, {"How likely are you to open a deposit account with our credit union if this new product were available?": "As a stay-at-home mom who values financial stability and planning for the future, I would rate my likelihood of opening a deposit account with your credit union at 8 out of 10. The Dream Saver Account seems like a great tool to help me achieve my financial goals, and the flexible terms and competitive interest rate are definitely appealing. However, I would need to do more research on the credit union's overall reputation and customer service before making a final decision."}, {"What would make you more likely to use this new deposit product?": "If the credit union offered additional incentives or rewards for opening a Dream Saver Account, such as a sign-up bonus or higher interest rates for larger deposits, that would definitely make me more likely to use this new deposit product. Additionally, if the credit union provided personalized financial advice or resources tailored to my specific savings goals, that would be a valuable added benefit. Finally, if the credit union had a user-friendly mobile app or online platform that made it easy to manage my account and track my progress towards my savings goals, that would be a big plus."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how important are competitive interest rates to you when considering a new deposit account?": "As a stay-at-home mom who is always looking for ways to save money, competitive interest rates are definitely important to me. I would rate their importance at 9 out of 10. While other features such as automated savings plans and financial education resources are also valuable, the interest rate is a key factor in determining the overall value of a deposit account."}, {"Would you be willing to commit to a certain time period (e.g. 12 months) in exchange for a higher interest rate on this new deposit product?": "Yes, I would definitely be willing to commit to a certain time period in exchange for a higher interest rate on the Dream Saver Account. While flexibility is important to me, I understand that committing to a longer-term savings plan can be beneficial in terms of achieving my financial goals. If the credit union offered a higher interest rate for a 12-month or 24-month commitment, for example, I would be willing to consider it. However, I would want to make sure that the terms of the commitment were clearly spelled out and that there were no penalties for early withdrawal in case of unforeseen circumstances."}, {"What other feedback do you have on this new deposit product?": "Overall, I think the Dream Saver Account is a great concept that could be very appealing to a wide range of customers. The flexible terms and automated savings plans make it easy to customize the account to fit individual savings goals, and the savings challenges and rewards are a fun way to stay motivated. I also appreciate the financial education resources that are available, as they can help customers make informed decisions about their finances and achieve their goals with confidence.\n\nOne suggestion I have is to make the account even more customizable by allowing customers to set up multiple savings goals within the same account. For example, I might want to save for both a down payment on a house and a family vacation, and it would be helpful if I could track my progress towards both goals separately. Additionally, it would be great if the credit union offered some kind of referral program or other incentives for existing customers to refer new members to the Dream Saver Account. This could help spread the word about the product and attract new customers to the credit union."}]
