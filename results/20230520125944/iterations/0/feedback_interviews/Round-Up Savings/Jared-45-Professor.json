[{"What features of this new deposit product interest you the most?": "As a consumer, I find the automatic savings feature of Round-Up Savings to be the most appealing. It's a convenient way to save money without having to think about it. I also like that I can set my own savings goals and transfer thresholds. The flexibility of the transfer options is another great feature. Lastly, the competitive interest rates are a nice bonus."}, {"What questions do you have about this new deposit product?": "I'm curious about the mechanics of how the product works. For example, how does the rounding up process work? Is it done automatically or do I have to manually round up each transaction? Also, are there any fees associated with the Round-Up Savings account? Lastly, what happens if I don't have enough funds in my checking account to cover the rounded-up amount?"}, {"How likely are you to open a deposit account with our credit union if this new product were available?": "As a consumer, I would rate my likelihood of opening a deposit account with your credit union if this new product were available as an 8 out of 10. The Round-Up Savings product is a unique and convenient way to save money, and the competitive interest rates make it even more appealing. However, I would need to know more about the fees and terms associated with the account before making a final decision."}, {"What would make you more likely to use this new deposit product?": "As an intellectual and introspective person, I value transparency and honesty. If your credit union could provide clear and concise information about the fees and terms associated with the Round-Up Savings account, that would make me more likely to use the product. Additionally, if there were any incentives or rewards for using the account, such as cashback or bonus interest rates, that would also be a motivating factor for me. Lastly, if your credit union has a reputation for excellent customer service and support, that would give me confidence in using the product."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how important are competitive interest rates to you when considering a new deposit account?": "As someone who is focused on saving for retirement and leaving behind a positive legacy, I would rate the importance of competitive interest rates when considering a new deposit account as a 9 out of 10. While convenience and flexibility are important, the ultimate goal of a deposit account is to grow and preserve wealth over time. Therefore, I would prioritize accounts that offer the best return on investment."}, {"Would you be willing to commit to a certain time period (e.g. 12 months) in exchange for a higher interest rate on this new deposit product?": "As someone who values flexibility, committing to a certain time period in exchange for a higher interest rate would not be my first choice. However, if the interest rate increase were significant enough and the terms were reasonable, I would consider it. Ultimately, it would depend on the specific details of the offer and how it fits into my overall financial plan."}, {"What other feedback do you have on this new deposit product?": "Overall, I think the Round-Up Savings product is a great idea. It's a convenient and easy way for members to save money without even thinking about it. However, I do have a few suggestions for improvement. \n\nFirst, it would be helpful if the credit union could provide more guidance on setting savings goals and transfer thresholds. As someone who is busy with work and other responsibilities, I don't always have the time or energy to figure out the best savings strategy on my own. If the credit union could offer personalized recommendations or tools to help me optimize my savings, that would be a big plus.\n\nSecond, it would be great if the credit union could offer more flexibility in terms of how the savings are allocated. For example, if I have multiple savings goals (e.g. emergency fund, vacation fund, etc.), it would be helpful if I could allocate my Round-Up Savings contributions to different accounts based on my priorities.\n\nLastly, it would be great if the credit union could offer more transparency around the impact of the Round-Up Savings account on my overall financial picture. For example, if I could see how much I've saved over time and how that compares to my other accounts and investments, that would give me a better sense of how the product is helping me achieve my financial goals."}]
