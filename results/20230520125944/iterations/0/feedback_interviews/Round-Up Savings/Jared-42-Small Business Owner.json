The flexible transfer options and competitive interest rates are also attractive features. It's important to me to have control over my savings and to earn a decent return on my money."}, {"What questions do you have about this new deposit product?": "I'm curious about the mechanics of how the Round-Up Savings product works. How exactly are the transactions rounded up and transferred to the savings account? Also, are there any fees associated with this product? And finally, what happens if there's not enough money in my checking account to cover the transfer to my savings account?"}, {"How likely are you to open a deposit account with our credit union if this new product were available?": "As a driven and analytical person, I would need to do some research and compare Round-Up Savings to other similar products in the market before making a decision. However, based on the features and benefits of this product, I would say that I am fairly likely to open a deposit account with your credit union if Round-Up Savings were available. I appreciate the convenience and flexibility that this product offers, and I think it could be a useful tool for helping me achieve my savings goals. On a scale of 1 to 10, I would say my likelihood is around 7 or 8."}, {"What would make you more likely to use this new deposit product?": "As a small business owner, I value transparency and simplicity in financial products. If the credit union could provide clear and concise information about the fees and terms associated with Round-Up Savings, that would make me more likely to use the product. Additionally, if the credit union offered incentives such as a sign-up bonus or higher interest rates for larger balances, that would also be a motivating factor for me. Finally, if the credit union could demonstrate a strong commitment to customer service and support, that would give me confidence in using this new deposit product."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how important are competitive interest rates to you when considering a new deposit account?": "As someone who is focused on achieving long-term financial goals, competitive interest rates are very important to me. On a scale of 1-10, I would rate the importance of competitive interest rates as a 9.

I want to make sure that my money is working hard for me and that I am maximizing my savings potential."}, {"Would you be willing to commit to a certain time period (e.g. 12 months) in exchange for a higher interest rate on this new deposit product?": "As a small business owner, I value flexibility in my financial products. While I understand the appeal of committing to a certain time period in exchange for a higher interest rate, I would prefer to have the option to withdraw my funds at any time without penalty. That being said, if the credit union offered a competitive interest rate without requiring a commitment, that would be ideal for me. I want to be able to save money on my own terms and without any restrictions."}, {"What other feedback do you have on this new deposit product?": "Overall, I think Round-Up Savings is a promising product that could be very useful for members who want to save money without having to think about it. I appreciate the flexibility and convenience that this product offers, and I think it could be a valuable tool for helping me achieve my savings goals.
