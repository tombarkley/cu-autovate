However, I do have a few suggestions for improvement. \n\nFirst, it would be helpful to have more flexibility around the transfer options. For example, instead of transferring the rounded-up amount to a savings account, members could have the option to transfer it to a checking account or apply it towards a credit card payment. \n\nSecond, it would be great if there were more customization options for setting savings goals and transfer thresholds. For example, members could set different goals and thresholds for different spending categories or time periods. \n\nFinally, I think it would be helpful to have more educational resources available to help members understand how the product works and how to make the most of it. This could include tutorials, FAQs, and personalized support from credit union staff."}]
