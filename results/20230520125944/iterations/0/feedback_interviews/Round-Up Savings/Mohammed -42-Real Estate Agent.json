For example, a bonus interest rate for reaching a certain savings threshold or for consistently using the product for a certain period of time would motivate me to continue using Round-Up Savings. Additionally, if the credit union provided educational resources on personal finance and savings strategies, it would show that they value education and would make me more likely to trust and use their products."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how important are competitive interest rates to you when considering a new deposit account?": "As someone who is analytical and values financial success and stability, competitive interest rates are very important to me when considering a new deposit account.

If the commitment period and interest rate were favorable, I would be willing to commit to a certain time period to maximize my savings."}, {"What other feedback do you have on this new deposit product?": "As someone who is personable and values helping others, I think it would be great if the credit union offered a charitable giving option as part of Round-Up Savings. For example, members could choose to round up their purchases to the nearest dollar and donate the difference to a charity of their choice. This would align with my values and would make me more likely to use the product. Additionally, it would be helpful if the credit union provided a mobile app or online portal where members could easily track their savings progress and adjust their savings goals and transfer options. Overall, I think Round-Up Savings is a great product that has the potential to attract new members and help existing members achieve their savings goals."}]
