[{"What features of this new deposit product interest you the most?": "As a stay-at-home mom, I'm always looking for ways to save money without having to think too much about it. The automatic savings feature of Round-Up Savings definitely catches my attention. I also appreciate the flexible transfer options and competitive interest rates. It sounds like a convenient and effective way to grow my savings without having to put in too much effort."}, {"What questions do you have about this new deposit product?": "I'm curious about the mechanics of how the rounding up process works. Will I be able to see the rounded-up amount on my transaction history? Also, what happens if I don't have enough funds in my checking account to cover the transfer to my Round-Up Savings account? Will there be any fees or penalties for that? Finally, what kind of support will be available to help me set my savings goals and transfer thresholds?"}, {"How likely are you to open a deposit account with our credit union if this new product were available?": "As someone who values saving money and appreciates convenience, I would say I am very likely to open a deposit account with your credit union if this new product were available. I would rate my likelihood as a 9 out of 10. The Round-Up Savings product seems like a great fit for my lifestyle and financial goals, and I would definitely consider switching to your credit union to take advantage of it."}, {"What would make you more likely to use this new deposit product?": "As a busy mom, I value simplicity and ease of use. If the enrollment process for Round-Up Savings is straightforward and user-friendly, that would definitely make me more likely to use the product. Additionally, if there are resources available to help me set my savings goals and track my progress, that would be a big plus. Finally, if the interest rates offered on Round-Up Savings are competitive with other financial institutions, that would be another factor that would make me more likely to use the product."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how important are competitive interest rates to you when considering a new deposit account?": "As someone who is always looking for ways to maximize my savings, I would say that competitive interest rates are very important to me when considering a new deposit account. I would rate their importance as a 9 out of 10. While convenience and ease of use are also important factors, ultimately the interest rates offered will have a big impact on my decision to open a new account."}, {"Would you be willing to commit to a certain time period (e.g. 12 months) in exchange for a higher interest rate on this new deposit product?": "As someone who values flexibility and likes to keep my options open, I would prefer not to commit to a specific time period in exchange for a higher interest rate on this new deposit product. While I understand that committing to a longer time period might result in a higher rate, I would prefer to have the option to withdraw my funds if needed without penalty. That being said, if the interest rate offered on Round-Up Savings is already competitive without requiring a commitment, that would be ideal for me."}, {"What other feedback do you have on this new deposit product?": "Overall, I think the Round-Up Savings product sounds like a great addition to your credit union's offerings. As a busy mom who is always looking for ways to save time and money, I appreciate the convenience and simplicity of the rounding up process. I also like that the product allows me to set my own savings goals and transfer thresholds. \n\nOne suggestion I have would be to offer some kind of incentive for members who consistently use Round-Up Savings over time. For example, you could offer a bonus interest rate for members who have been enrolled in the program for a certain period of time or who have reached a certain savings goal. This could be a great way to encourage long-term engagement with the product and reward members for their commitment to saving. \n\nOverall, I think Round-Up Savings has a lot of potential to attract new members and help existing members achieve their financial goals."}]
