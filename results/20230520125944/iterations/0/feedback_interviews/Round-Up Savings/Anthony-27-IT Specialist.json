The Round-Up Savings feature is very appealing to me and would make it easier for me to reach my savings goals.

However, the length of the commitment and the interest rate offered would need to be reasonable and competitive with other financial institutions. I would also want to make sure that there are no penalties for early withdrawal in case of an emergency."}, {"What other feedback do you have on this new deposit product?": "Overall, I think the Round-Up Savings product is a great idea and has the potential to attract new members to your credit union. However, I would suggest that you consider adding some additional features to make it even more appealing. For example, you could offer a matching contribution program where the credit union matches a certain percentage of the member's Round-Up Savings deposits. You could also consider offering rewards or incentives for reaching certain savings milestones. Additionally, it would be helpful if the credit union provided educational resources or financial planning tools to help members set and achieve their savings goals."}]
