It seems like a convenient and easy way to save money without even thinking about it."}, {"What questions do you have about this new deposit product?": "I'm curious about the mechanics of the product. How exactly does the rounding up process work? Will I be able to see a breakdown of my savings and transactions? Also, what are the transfer thresholds and frequency options? And finally, what happens if I need to access my savings before reaching my savings goal?"}, {"How likely are you to open a deposit account with our credit union if this new product were available?": "As an outgoing and optimistic person who values financial success and personal growth, I would rate my likelihood of opening a deposit account with your credit union at an 8 out of 10. The Round-Up Savings product seems like a convenient and innovative way to save money, and I appreciate the competitive interest rates and flexible transfer options. However, I would need to do some more research on your credit union and compare it to other options before making a final decision."}, {"What would make you more likely to use this new deposit product?": "As a startup founder, managing stress and finding work-life balance are some of my biggest challenges. If your credit union could offer additional resources or tools to help me manage my finances and achieve my savings goals, that would definitely make me more likely to use this new deposit product. For example, if you offered financial planning services or educational resources on how to save money and invest wisely, I would be more inclined to trust your credit union and consider opening a deposit account. Additionally, if you had a user-friendly mobile app or online platform that made it easy to track my savings and transactions, that would also be a big plus."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how important are competitive interest rates to you when considering a new deposit account?": "As someone who values financial success and wants to make the most of my savings, competitive interest rates are definitely important to me. I would rate their importance at a 9 out of 10. While other factors like convenience and flexibility are also important, I want to make sure that my money is working as hard as possible for me and earning the highest possible return."}, {"Would you be willing to commit to a certain time period (e.g. 12 months) in exchange for a higher interest rate on this new deposit product?": "As an optimistic and resourceful person, I'm always open to exploring new opportunities and trying out different strategies to achieve my goals. So, I would definitely consider committing to a certain time period in exchange for a higher interest rate on this new deposit product. However, I would need to carefully evaluate the terms and conditions of the commitment and make sure that it aligns with my financial goals and needs. If the commitment period and interest rate offer a good balance of risk and reward, I would be willing to give it a try."}, {"What other feedback do you have on this new deposit product?": "Overall, I think the Round-Up Savings product is a great idea and has a lot of potential to attract new members and help them save money. However, here are a few additional thoughts and suggestions:\n\n- It would be helpful to have some guidance or recommendations on how to set savings goals and transfer thresholds. For example, if your credit union could provide some benchmarks or best practices based on other members' experiences, that would be useful.\n- It would also be nice to have some customization options for the rounding up process. For example, if I could choose to round up to the nearest $0.50 or $5 instead of just $1, that would give me more control over my savings.\n- Finally, it would be great if your credit union could offer some incentives or rewards for reaching certain savings milestones. For example, if I save $1,000 in my Round-Up Savings account, I could receive a bonus interest rate or a cash reward. This would motivate me to save more and make the experience more fun and engaging."}]
