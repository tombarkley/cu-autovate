[{"What features of this new deposit product interest you the most?": "As a software engineer with a fluctuating income, I'm always looking for ways to save money without having to think about it too much. The automatic savings on everyday purchases feature of Round-Up Savings is definitely the most appealing to me. It would be great to have a product that helps me save money without having to actively think about it. Additionally, the flexible transfer options and competitive interest rates are also attractive features."}, {"What questions do you have about this new deposit product?": "I'm curious about the mechanics of the product. How exactly does the rounding up process work? Will I be able to see the rounded-up amount on my transaction history? Also, what are the transfer options for the savings account? Can I transfer the money back to my checking account if I need it? Finally, what are the interest rates for the savings account? Are they competitive compared to other savings accounts in the market?"}, {"How likely are you to open a deposit account with our credit union if this new product were available?": "As someone who values simplicity and automatic savings, I would rate my likelihood of opening a deposit account with your credit union at an 8 out of 10 if this new product were available. The Round-Up Savings product seems like a great fit for my financial goals and lifestyle, and I appreciate the flexibility it offers in terms of transfer options and frequency. However, I would need to compare the interest rates with other savings accounts in the market before making a final decision."}, {"What would make you more likely to use this new deposit product?": "As someone who values independence and long-term success, I would be more likely to use this new deposit product if it offered additional tools or resources to help me achieve my financial goals. For example, if the credit union offered financial planning services or educational resources on investing, that would make me more likely to use the Round-Up Savings product. Additionally, if the credit union had a user-friendly mobile app that made it easy to track my savings progress and transfer money between accounts, that would also be a big plus."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how important are competitive interest rates to you when considering a new deposit account?": "As someone who is focused on long-term success and building an independent future, competitive interest rates are very important to me when considering a new deposit account. I would rate their importance at a 9 out of 10. While automatic savings and flexible transfer options are attractive features, the ultimate goal of a savings account is to earn interest on my money. Therefore, I would need to ensure that the interest rates offered by the credit union are competitive with other savings accounts in the market before making a decision."}, {"Would you be willing to commit to a certain time period (e.g. 12 months) in exchange for a higher interest rate on this new deposit product?": "As someone who values flexibility and independence, I would be hesitant to commit to a certain time period in exchange for a higher interest rate on this new deposit product. While a higher interest rate is certainly attractive, I would want to ensure that I have the freedom to withdraw my money if I need it without penalty. However, if the credit union offered a flexible commitment option that allowed me to withdraw my money penalty-free after a certain amount of time (e.g. 6 months), I would be more open to considering it. Ultimately, the decision would depend on the specific terms and conditions of the commitment option."}, {"What other feedback do you have on this new deposit product?": "Overall, I think the Round-Up Savings product is a great idea and would be a good fit for my financial goals and lifestyle. I appreciate the automatic savings feature and the flexibility it offers in terms of transfer options and frequency. However, I would like to see more transparency around the interest rates offered by the credit union. It would also be helpful if the credit union offered additional tools or resources to help me achieve my financial goals, such as financial planning services or educational resources on investing. Additionally, a user-friendly mobile app that made it easy to track my savings progress and transfer money between accounts would be a big plus."}]
