Will they be tailored to individual members' savings goals, or will they be more general? What kind of rewards can members expect for meeting the challenges? \n\nSecond, I would like to know more about any fees associated with the Savings Challenge Account, as well as any restrictions on withdrawals. It would be helpful to have a clear understanding of these factors before deciding whether to open an account. \n\nFinally, I think it would be helpful to have more information about the tiered interest rates and how they work. For example, what are the different tiers, and how do they correspond to different savings periods? How much of an increase in interest rate can members expect for longer savings periods? \n\nOverall, I think this is a very promising product, and I appreciate the opportunity to provide feedback and suggestions for improvement."}]
