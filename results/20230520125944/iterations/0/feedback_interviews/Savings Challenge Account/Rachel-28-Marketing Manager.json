The Savings Challenge Account sounds like a fun and engaging way to save money, and the tiered interest rates and monthly challenges with rewards are features that would motivate me to save more. Additionally, having access to financial education resources and tools is important to me as I strive to make informed decisions about my finances. However, the specific interest rates and fees associated with the account would also factor into my decision."}, {"What would make you more likely to use this new deposit product?": "As someone who is currently navigating the housing market in a competitive city and trying to pay off student loans, anything that can help me save more money would be a huge plus.

However, the specific length of time and interest rate would need to be competitive and align with my savings goals. If the commitment period and interest rate were reasonable and aligned with my goals, I would be willing to commit to a certain time period to earn a higher interest rate."}, {"What other feedback do you have on this new deposit product?": "Overall, I think the Savings Challenge Account is a great idea and has the potential to be a valuable tool for members who are looking to save more money. However, there are a few areas where I think the product could be improved. \n\nFirst, it would be helpful if the credit union provided more guidance on how to set personalized savings goals. While the idea of setting goals based on individual needs and interests is appealing, some members may not know where to start or how to set realistic goals. Providing more resources or tools to help members set and track their goals would be beneficial.\n\nSecond, while the monthly challenges with rewards are a great way to keep members engaged and motivated, it would be helpful if the challenges were more tailored to individual interests and goals. For example, if a member is saving for a down payment on a house, a challenge related to reducing expenses or increasing income would be more relevant than a challenge related to saving for a vacation.\n\nFinally, it would be helpful if the credit union offered additional incentives or benefits for members who use the Savings Challenge Account. For example, offering a higher interest rate or waiving fees for members who meet certain savings milestones would be a great way to reward and motivate members."}]
