I'm also wondering if there are any fees associated with the Savings Challenge Account, and if so, how they compare to other deposit products. Finally, I'd like to know more about the financial education resources and tools that will be available - will they be personalized to each member's unique financial situation, or more general in nature?"}, {"How likely are you to open a deposit account with our credit union if this new product were available?": "As a creative and entrepreneurial person, I'm always interested in trying out new products and services that can help me achieve my goals. Based on the features of this new deposit product, I would say I'm very likely to open a Savings Challenge Account with your credit union if it were available. The automatic savings transfers, tiered interest rates, and monthly challenges with rewards all sound like great incentives to help me save more money and stay motivated along the way. Plus, as someone who values financial education and resources, I appreciate that those will be available as well."}, {"What would make you more likely to use this new deposit product?": "As a small business owner, I'm always looking for ways to streamline my finances and make things as easy as possible. So, anything that can simplify the process of opening and managing a Savings Challenge Account would be a big plus for me. For example, if there were a mobile app that made it easy to set up automatic transfers and track my progress towards my savings goals, that would be a big selling point. Additionally, if there were any special promotions or incentives for new members who sign up for the Savings Challenge Account, that would definitely make me more likely to give it a try. Finally, if there were any opportunities to earn even higher interest rates or rewards for meeting more challenging savings goals, that would be a great motivator for me to continue using the product over time."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how important are competitive interest rates to you when considering a new deposit account?": "As someone who is always looking for ways to save money and grow my savings, competitive interest rates are definitely important to me. I would say they are a 9 out of 10 in terms of importance when considering a new deposit account. While other features like automatic savings transfers and monthly challenges with rewards are also appealing, ultimately the interest rate is what will determine how much my savings will grow over time. So, I want to make sure I'm getting the best rate possible for my money."}, {"Would you be willing to commit to a certain time period (e.g. 12 months) in exchange for a higher interest rate on this new deposit product?": "As someone who is committed to growing my savings over time, I would definitely be open to committing to a certain time period in exchange for a higher interest rate on this new deposit product. For example, if there were an option to lock in a higher rate for 12 months or longer, I would be willing to consider it. However, I would want to make sure that the terms of the commitment were clear and transparent, and that there were no penalties or fees for withdrawing my money early if needed. Ultimately, I want to make sure that I have flexibility and control over my savings, while still being able to take advantage of the best possible interest rates."}, {"What other feedback do you have on this new deposit product?": "Overall, I think this new deposit product sounds like a great option for people who are looking to save money in a fun and engaging way. I appreciate the focus on automatic savings transfers, tiered interest rates, and monthly challenges with rewards, as well as the availability of financial education resources and tools. However, there are a few additional features that I think would make this product even more appealing to me and other potential customers. \n\nFirst, as someone who values sustainability and social responsibility, I would love to see the credit union incorporate some kind of eco-friendly or socially responsible element into the product. For example, perhaps a portion of the interest earned could be donated to a local environmental or social justice organization. \n\nSecond, I think it would be helpful to have more personalized savings goals and challenges that are tailored to each member's unique financial situation and goals. For example, if I'm saving up for a specific business expense or trip, it would be great to have a challenge that is specifically geared towards helping me reach that goal. \n\nFinally, I think it would be helpful to have more transparency around the fees and costs associated with the Savings Challenge Account. While I understand that there may be some fees for certain services or transactions, I want to make sure that I'm not being charged excessive fees that eat into my savings over time. Overall, I think these additional features would make the Savings Challenge Account an even more compelling option for customers like me."}]
