What kind of goals would they entail and what kind of rewards could members expect for meeting them? Also, are there any fees associated with this account, and if so, how do they compare to other savings accounts on the market? Finally, I'm wondering if there are any limitations on how much money can be deposited into the account or how frequently transfers can be made."}, {"How likely are you to open a deposit account with our credit union if this new product were available?": "As an outgoing, resourceful, and optimistic person who values financial success and personal growth, I would say I'm very likely to open a deposit account with your credit union if this new product were available.

For example, if there were tools or resources available to help me manage my finances more effectively or to connect with other entrepreneurs in my area, that would be a big draw. Additionally, if there were opportunities to earn even higher interest rates or bigger rewards for meeting savings milestones, that would be a great incentive to use the account more frequently.

Depending on the interest rate and the terms of the commitment, I could see myself committing to a period of 6 months, 12 months, or even longer. However, I would want to make sure that the terms of the commitment were reasonable and that I would still have access to my funds if I needed them before the commitment period was up."}, {"What other feedback do you have on this new deposit product?": "Overall, I think the Savings Challenge Account is a great concept and has a lot of potential to attract new members and help existing members save money. I appreciate the emphasis on financial education and the monthly challenges with rewards, as I think those features will help keep members engaged and motivated to save. However, I do have a few suggestions for improvement. \n\nFirst, I would like to see more transparency around the fees associated with this account. While I understand that fees are a necessary part of banking, I think it's important for members to know exactly what they're paying for and how those fees compare to other savings accounts on the market. \n\nSecond, I think it would be helpful to have more flexibility around the personalized savings goals. While I appreciate the automatic savings transfers, I think it would be even better if members could adjust their goals on a more frequent basis to reflect changes in their financial situation or goals. \n\nFinally, I would like to see more options for accessing the account and managing funds. While I appreciate the focus on digital tools and resources, I think it's important to offer a variety of options for members who prefer to bank in person or over the phone. Overall, though, I think this is a great product and I would definitely consider opening an account if the fees and terms were reasonable."}]
