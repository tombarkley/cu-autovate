Finally, if the product is not marketed effectively or if the user interface is difficult to use, it may be challenging to attract and retain users."}, {"Would you be more likely to use this product if it had a rewards program?": "Yes, I think a rewards program would be a great incentive to use this product. The monthly challenges with rewards are already a great feature, but if there were additional rewards for meeting certain savings milestones or for referring friends to the credit union, that would be even more motivating. Rewards could come in the form of bonus interest, cash bonuses, or even discounts on other credit union products and services. Overall, I think a rewards program would make the Savings Challenge Account even more appealing to potential users."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how important is the interest rate for this product to you?": "As someone who values financial stability, the interest rate is very important to me. I would rate it as a 9 out of 10. While the other features of the product are also important, the interest rate is what will ultimately determine how much money I can save and how quickly I can reach my goals. If the interest rate is not competitive with other savings accounts, I may be less likely to use this product."}, {"What benefits do you see in this product that are not offered by other financial institutions?": "I think the monthly challenges with rewards are a unique feature that sets this product apart from other savings accounts offered by financial institutions.

As a software engineer, I rely heavily on my smartphone for many aspects of my life, including managing my finances. Having a mobile app would make it much easier for me to access my Savings Challenge Account and track my progress towards my savings goals. Additionally, a mobile app could provide push notifications for monthly challenges and rewards, which would help keep me motivated and engaged with the product. Overall, I think a mobile app would be a great addition to the Savings Challenge Account and would make it even more appealing to potential users like myself."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to recommend this product to a family member?": "As someone who values financial stability and is looking for ways to save money, I would rate my likelihood of recommending this product to a family member as a 9 out of 10.
