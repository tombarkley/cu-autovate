[{"What features of the product are most important to you?": "As a financial advisor, I think the automatic savings transfers based on personalized savings goals and the tiered interest rates based on length of time money is saved are the most important features. These features will help members save money in a more structured and efficient way, while also earning higher interest rates for longer savings periods. The monthly challenges with rewards are also a great way to keep members engaged and motivated to reach their savings goals."}, {"How frequently would you use this product?": "As a financial advisor, I wouldn't personally use this product since I already have a good savings plan in place. However, I would recommend this product to my clients who are looking for a fun and engaging way to save money. The frequency of use would depend on each individual's savings goals and financial situation, but I would encourage my clients to use this product on a regular basis to help them achieve their savings goals."}, {"What potential barriers do you see to using this product?": "One potential barrier I see is that some members may not be comfortable with setting up automatic transfers from their checking account into their Savings Challenge Account. They may prefer to manually transfer money into their savings account on their own schedule. Another potential barrier is that some members may not be motivated by the monthly challenges and rewards, and may lose interest in using the product over time. Finally, some members may prefer to use other savings products that offer higher interest rates or different features that better suit their needs."}, {"Would you be more likely to use this product if it had a rewards program?": "As a financial advisor, I personally wouldn't be more likely to use this product if it had a rewards program since I already have a good savings plan in place. However, I think a rewards program could be a great way to incentivize members to use the product and stay engaged with their savings goals. The rewards could be tailored to each member's individual preferences and could include things like bonus interest, cash bonuses, or other perks. Overall, I think a rewards program could be a great addition to the Savings Challenge Account and could help attract new members to the credit union."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how important is the interest rate for this product to you?": "As a financial advisor, I would rate the importance of interest rate for this product as an 8 out of 10. While the other features of the product such as automatic savings transfers and monthly challenges are important, the interest rate is a key factor in attracting and retaining members. A competitive interest rate can help incentivize members to save more money and keep their funds within the credit union. However, it's important to note that the interest rate should be balanced with other features of the product to ensure that it remains attractive and engaging to members."}, {"What benefits do you see in this product that are not offered by other financial institutions?": "As a financial advisor, I think the Savings Challenge Account offers several benefits that are not commonly found in other savings products offered by financial institutions. These benefits include:\n\n1. Personalized savings goals: The automatic savings transfers based on personalized savings goals allow members to set specific savings targets and track their progress towards those goals.\n\n2. Tiered interest rates: The tiered interest rates based on length of time money is saved offer higher interest rates for longer savings periods, which can help incentivize members to save more money over time.\n\n3. Monthly challenges with rewards: The monthly challenges with rewards offer a fun and engaging way for members to stay motivated and on track with their savings goals.\n\n4. Access to financial education resources and tools: The access to financial education resources and tools such as budgeting tools, savings calculators, and educational articles can help members make smart financial decisions and improve their overall financial literacy.\n\nOverall, I think the Savings Challenge Account offers a unique combination of features that can help members save money in a more structured and efficient way, while also staying engaged and motivated to reach their savings goals."}, {"Would you be more likely to use this product if there was a mobile app available?": "As a financial advisor, I think having a mobile app available for the Savings Challenge Account would be a great addition to the product. A mobile app would make it easier for members to track their savings progress, set up automatic transfers, and access financial education resources and tools on-the-go. It would also make the product more convenient and accessible for members who prefer to manage their finances through their mobile devices. Overall, I think a mobile app would enhance the user experience and make the Savings Challenge Account more appealing to members who are looking for a modern and convenient savings solution."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to recommend this product to a family member?": "As a financial advisor, I would rate my likelihood to recommend this product to a family member as a 9 out of 10. I think the Savings Challenge Account offers a unique combination of features that can help members save money in a more structured and efficient way, while also staying engaged and motivated to reach their savings goals. The personalized savings goals, tiered interest rates, monthly challenges with rewards, and access to financial education resources and tools make this product stand out from other savings products offered by financial institutions. The only reason I wouldn't rate it a 10 out of 10 is because some members may prefer other savings products that offer different features or higher interest rates that better suit their needs."}]
