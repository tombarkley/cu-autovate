[{"What features of the product are most important to you?": "As a software developer, I appreciate the automatic savings transfers based on personalized savings goals. It's important for me to have a clear understanding of how much I need to save and when. I also like the idea of tiered interest rates based on length of time money is saved, as it provides an incentive to save for longer periods of time. The monthly challenges with rewards for meeting savings milestones also sound like a fun way to stay motivated and engaged. Finally, access to financial education resources and tools is always a plus, as it helps me make informed decisions about my finances."}, {"How frequently would you use this product?": "I would use this product on a regular basis, probably at least once a month when I receive the new savings challenge. I would also set up automatic transfers to my Savings Challenge Account based on my personalized savings goals, so I would be using the product on a continuous basis."}, {"What potential barriers do you see to using this product?": "One potential barrier I see is the possibility of forgetting to transfer money into the Savings Challenge Account. While automatic transfers can help with this, there may be times when I need to adjust my savings goals or transfer amounts manually. Another potential barrier could be the rewards for meeting savings milestones not being motivating enough for some people. Finally, if the interest rates offered are not competitive with other savings accounts, it may not be worth it for me to use this product."}, {"Would you be more likely to use this product if it had a rewards program?": "Yes, I would be more likely to use this product if it had a rewards program. Rewards can be a great motivator for me to stay on track with my savings goals, and they can make the process of saving money more fun and engaging. It would also be nice to have a variety of rewards to choose from, such as bonus interest or cash bonuses, so that I can choose the reward that best fits my needs and preferences."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how important is the interest rate for this product to you?": "As someone who values financial independence and wants to make the most of my savings, I would say the interest rate is very important to me. I would rate it as a 9 out of 10. While the other features of the product are important, the interest rate is ultimately what will determine whether or not it's worth it for me to use this product over other savings accounts."}, {"What benefits do you see in this product that are not offered by other financial institutions?": "I think the monthly challenges with rewards for meeting savings milestones are a unique feature that sets this product apart from other savings accounts. It's a fun and engaging way to stay motivated and on track with my savings goals. Additionally, the access to financial education resources and tools is a valuable benefit that not all financial institutions offer. It shows that the credit union is invested in helping its members make informed financial decisions and achieve their financial goals. Finally, the tiered interest rates based on length of time money is saved is another unique feature that can incentivize me to save for longer periods of time."}, {"Would you be more likely to use this product if there was a mobile app available?": "Yes, I would be more likely to use this product if there was a mobile app available. As a software developer, I'm always on my phone and prefer to manage my finances on-the-go. A mobile app would make it more convenient for me to access my Savings Challenge Account, check my savings progress, and adjust my savings goals or transfer amounts as needed. It would also be great if the app had push notifications to remind me of upcoming challenges or milestones."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to recommend this product to a family member?": "As someone who values financial education and wants to make the most of my savings, I would rate my likelihood of recommending this product to a family member as an 8 out of 10. I think the Savings Challenge Account has some unique features that can help people stay motivated and on track with their savings goals, and the access to financial education resources and tools is a valuable benefit. However, the interest rate offered would be a key factor in my recommendation, as it needs to be competitive with other savings accounts for me to feel confident in recommending it to others."}]
