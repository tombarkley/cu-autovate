[{"What features of the product are most important to you?": "As a real estate agent, I'm always on the go and don't have a lot of time to manually transfer money into savings.

And of course, competitive interest rates are always a plus."}, {"How frequently would you use this product?": "I would use this product on a daily basis, as I make multiple purchases with my debit card each day. So, the Round-Up Savings feature would allow me to save small amounts of money each time I make a purchase without even thinking about it."}, {"What potential barriers do you see to using this product?": "One potential barrier I see is if the transfer amounts are too small, it may not feel like I'm making a significant impact on my savings goals. Another barrier could be if the transfer frequency is too high, it could lead to overdrafts or insufficient funds in my checking account. Lastly, if the interest rates offered are not competitive, I may not see the benefit of using this product over other savings options."}, {"Would you be more likely to use this product if it had a rewards program?": "As someone who values financial rewards, a rewards program would definitely make me more likely to use this product.
