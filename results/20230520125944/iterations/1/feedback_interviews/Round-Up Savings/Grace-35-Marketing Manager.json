Finally, the competitive interest rates are also a benefit that sets this product apart from others."}, {"Would you be more likely to use this product if there was a mobile app available?": "As someone who is always on-the-go, having a mobile app available would make it easier for me to manage my savings and track my progress towards my goals.
