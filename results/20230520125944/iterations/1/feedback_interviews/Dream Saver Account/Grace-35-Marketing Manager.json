On a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate my frequency of use as an 8."}, {"What potential barriers do you see to using this product?": "One potential barrier I see is the minimum deposit of $100 to open the account. While this may not be a significant amount for some people, it could be a barrier for others who are just starting to save or who have limited funds available. Additionally, if the interest rate is not competitive compared to other savings accounts, that could be a barrier for me as well. Finally, if the savings challenges are too difficult or require too much effort, that could also be a barrier to my participation."}, {"Would you be more likely to use this product if it had a rewards program?": "As someone who is motivated by rewards and incentives, I would definitely be more likely to use this product if it had a rewards program. The savings challenges and bonus interest are already appealing features, but if there were additional rewards such as cashback or discounts on other products or services, that would be even more motivating for me. Overall, I think a rewards program would be a great way to encourage me to save more and stay engaged with the product."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how important is the interest rate for this product to you?": "As someone who values financial stability and wants to maximize my savings, the interest rate is an important factor for me when considering a savings account.

A competitive interest rate would not only help me reach my savings goals faster, but it would also make me feel more confident in my financial decisions and my choice of financial institution."}, {"What benefits do you see in this product that are not offered by other financial institutions?": "One benefit that stands out to me is the savings challenges and rewards. While other financial institutions may offer competitive interest rates and flexible terms, the savings challenges and rewards are a unique feature that could help me stay motivated and engaged with my savings goals. Additionally, the financial education resources such as webinars, articles, and personalized advice from experts are also a valuable benefit that not all financial institutions offer.

Additionally, if the app had features such as push notifications to remind me of upcoming savings challenges or milestones, that would be even more helpful. Overall, a mobile app would be a great addition to this product and would make me more likely to use it."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to recommend this product to a family member?": "As someone who values financial stability and wants to help my family members achieve their financial goals, I would be very likely to recommend this product to a family member.
