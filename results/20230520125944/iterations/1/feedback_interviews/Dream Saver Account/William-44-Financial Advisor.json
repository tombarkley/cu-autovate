Additionally, some members may not be interested in the savings challenges and rewards, and may prefer a more straightforward savings account. Finally, some members may not be interested in the financial education resources if they already feel confident in their financial knowledge."}, {"Would you be more likely to use this product if it had a rewards program?": "As a financial advisor, I wouldn't personally use this product, but I think a rewards program could be a great incentive for members to save more. The savings challenges and rewards already included in the product are a good start, but if the credit union were to add additional rewards such as cashback or discounts on other products and services, it could make the product even more attractive to potential users. Overall, I think a rewards program could be a positive addition to the product."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how important is the interest rate for this product to you?": "As a financial advisor, I believe that the interest rate is an important factor to consider when choosing a savings account.

Firstly, the automated savings plans and savings challenges with rewards are unique features that can help motivate members to save more. Secondly, the financial education resources such as webinars, articles, and personalized advice from experts are not commonly offered by other financial institutions.

Finally, the penalty-free withdrawal once per year or the option to roll over the balance into a new savings plan at the end of the term are also unique features that can provide flexibility for members. Overall, the combination of these unique features makes this product stand out from other savings accounts offered by financial institutions."}, {"Would you be more likely to use this product if there was a mobile app available?": "As a financial advisor, I believe that having a mobile app available for this product would be a great convenience for members and could make it more attractive to potential users. A mobile app would allow members to easily track their savings progress, set up automated transfers, and access financial education resources on-the-go.

While a mobile app is not essential for all members, it can be a valuable tool for those who prefer to manage their finances digitally."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to recommend this product to a family member?": "As a financial advisor, I believe that this product has several unique features that could benefit many individuals looking to save for their long-term financial goals.
