[{"What features of the product are most important to you?": "As a software developer, I value flexibility and automation. So, the flexible terms and automated savings plans are definitely appealing to me. Additionally, the savings challenges and rewards sound like a fun way to stay motivated and on track towards achieving my goals. And of course, a competitive interest rate is always a plus!"}, {"How frequently would you use this product?": "I would use this product regularly, probably on a monthly basis. I like the idea of setting up automated transfers from my checking account or payroll to make saving easier and more consistent. And if there are savings challenges and rewards, that would give me even more incentive to use the product frequently."}, {"What potential barriers do you see to using this product?": "One potential barrier for me would be if there are any fees associated with the account. As someone who is already paying off student loans, I want to make sure that I'm not incurring any unnecessary fees. Additionally, if the process of setting up the account or customizing my savings plan is too complicated or time-consuming, that could be a barrier for me as well. I want the process to be as simple and user-friendly as possible."}, {"Would you be more likely to use this product if it had a rewards program?": "Yes, I would definitely be more likely to use this product if it had a rewards program. As someone who is motivated by achieving success and gaining recognition, the idea of earning bonus interest or other rewards for completing savings challenges is very appealing to me. It would make the process of saving more fun and engaging, and would give me an extra incentive to stay on track towards achieving my goals."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how important is the interest rate for this product to you?": "As someone who is ambitious and values independence, achieving my long-term financial goals is very important to me. So, the interest rate is definitely an important factor when considering a savings account. I would rate it as an 8 out of 10. While I don't want to sacrifice flexibility or other features for a slightly higher interest rate, I do want to make sure that I'm earning a competitive rate that will help me reach my goals faster."}, {"What benefits do you see in this product that are not offered by other financial institutions?": "One benefit that stands out to me is the savings challenges and rewards. I haven't seen many other financial institutions offer this type of feature, and I think it's a great way to keep members engaged and motivated to save. Additionally, the financial education resources are a unique feature that could be very valuable for members who want to learn more about managing their finances and making informed decisions. Finally, the penalty-free withdrawal once per year and the option to roll over the balance into a new savings plan at the end of the term are both flexible features that I haven't seen in many other savings accounts."}, {"Would you be more likely to use this product if there was a mobile app available?": "Yes, I would definitely be more likely to use this product if there was a mobile app available. As a software developer, I'm used to using technology to manage different aspects of my life, including my finances. A mobile app would make it easier for me to check my account balance, set up automated transfers, and complete savings challenges on-the-go. It would also make the process of managing my savings more convenient and accessible, which is always a plus."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to recommend this product to a family member?": "As someone who values loyalty and maintaining relationships, I would only recommend a product to a family member if I truly believed it was a good fit for their needs. Based on what I've heard about the Dream Saver Account so far, I think it could be a great option for someone who is looking to save for a specific goal and wants a flexible, user-friendly account with unique features like savings challenges and financial education resources. So, I would rate my likelihood of recommending this product to a family member as a 9 out of 10."}]
