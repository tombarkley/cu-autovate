[{"What features of the product are most important to you?": "As a real estate agent, I am always looking for ways to save for my long-term financial goals while also having access to my funds for short-term needs. So, the flexible terms and penalty-free withdrawal once per year are very appealing to me. Additionally, the automated savings plans and savings challenges with rewards are great motivators to keep me on track towards achieving my savings goals. Lastly, the financial education resources are a valuable tool to help me make informed decisions about my finances."}, {"How frequently would you use this product?": "As someone who is always looking to save for my long-term financial goals, I would use this product on a regular basis. I would set up automated transfers from my checking account or payroll to the Dream Saver Account and actively participate in the savings challenges to earn bonus interest. Additionally, I would access the financial education resources to help me make informed decisions about my finances. I would estimate that I would use this product at least once a month. On a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate my frequency of use as an 8."}, {"What potential barriers do you see to using this product?": "One potential barrier I see is the minimum deposit of $100 to open the account. While this is not a significant amount, some people may not have that much money available to deposit at once. Another potential barrier is the requirement to set up automated transfers from a checking account or payroll. Some people may prefer to manually transfer funds into the account or may not have a checking account or payroll to link to the account. Lastly, some people may not be motivated by the savings challenges and rewards, and may not see the value in participating in them."}, {"Would you be more likely to use this product if it had a rewards program?": "As someone who is motivated by rewards, I would definitely be more likely to use this product if it had a rewards program. The savings challenges and rewards already included in the product are a great start, but if there were additional rewards for achieving certain milestones or reaching higher savings goals, that would be even more motivating. For example, if there were cash bonuses or gift cards for reaching a certain savings amount or for consistently meeting monthly savings goals, that would be a great incentive for me to continue using the product."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how important is the interest rate for this product to you?": "As someone who is always looking for ways to maximize my savings, the interest rate is an important factor for me when considering a savings account. On a scale of 1-10, I would rate the importance of the interest rate for this product as an 8. While the other features such as flexible terms and savings challenges are also important, a competitive interest rate is crucial for me to consider this product as a viable option for my savings goals."}, {"What benefits do you see in this product that are not offered by other financial institutions?": "One benefit that stands out to me is the savings challenges and rewards. While other financial institutions may offer savings accounts with competitive interest rates and flexible terms, I have not seen many that offer unique savings challenges and rewards to help motivate customers to save more. Additionally, the financial education resources are a valuable tool that not all financial institutions offer. Having access to webinars, articles, and personalized advice from experts can help customers make informed decisions about their finances and achieve their goals with confidence. Lastly, the penalty-free withdrawal once per year or the ability to roll over the balance into a new savings plan at the end of the term is a feature that not all financial institutions offer. This provides customers with flexibility and peace of mind knowing that they can access their funds if needed without facing penalties or fees."}, {"Would you be more likely to use this product if there was a mobile app available?": "As someone who is always on-the-go, having a mobile app available for this product would definitely make it more convenient for me to use. I would be able to easily check my account balance, track my progress towards my savings goals, and participate in savings challenges from my phone. Additionally, having a mobile app would make it easier for me to set up and manage automated transfers from my checking account or payroll. On a scale of 1-10, I would rate the importance of a mobile app for this product as a 9."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to recommend this product to a family member?": "As someone who is always looking for ways to save for my long-term financial goals, I would rate my likelihood of recommending this product to a family member as a 9. The Dream Saver Account offers competitive interest rates, flexible terms, and unique savings challenges and rewards that can help motivate customers to save more. Additionally, the financial education resources and penalty-free withdrawal options provide customers with valuable tools and flexibility. Overall, I think this product has a lot of potential to help customers achieve their financial goals and I would definitely recommend it to a family member who is looking for a new savings account."}]
