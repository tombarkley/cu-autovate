I think the automated savings plans and savings challenges would encourage me to save more frequently and consistently towards my long-term financial goals."}, {"What potential barriers do you see to using this product?": "One potential barrier I see is the minimum deposit of $100 to open the account. Some people may not have that amount of money readily available to deposit into a new savings account. Additionally, some people may be hesitant to commit to a long-term savings plan with specific terms and conditions. Finally, some people may prefer to use other savings vehicles such as a traditional savings account or a certificate of deposit."}, {"Would you be more likely to use this product if it had a rewards program?": "Yes, I think a rewards program would definitely make me more likely to use this product. It would be motivating to earn bonus interest or other rewards for completing savings challenges or reaching specific milestones.

While a competitive interest rate is important, the other features such as automated savings plans, savings challenges, and financial education resources are also very valuable to me."}, {"What benefits do you see in this product that are not offered by other financial institutions?": "I think the unique features of this product such as the savings challenges and rewards, automated savings plans, and financial education resources are not commonly offered by other financial institutions.

Overall, I think this product offers a comprehensive package of benefits that could set it apart from other financial institutions."}, {"Would you be more likely to use this product if there was a mobile app available?": "Yes, I would definitely be more likely to use this product if there was a mobile app available.
