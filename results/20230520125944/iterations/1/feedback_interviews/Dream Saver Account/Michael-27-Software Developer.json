While this is not a significant amount, it could be a barrier for some people who are just starting to save or who have limited funds available.

The idea of earning bonus interest by completing savings challenges or reaching specific milestones is very appealing to me as it would help keep me motivated and engaged in the savings process.

Additionally, the financial education resources such as webinars, articles, and personalized advice from experts are a great value-add that can help members make informed decisions about their finances and achieve their goals with confidence. Finally, the penalty-free withdrawal once per year and the ability to roll over the balance into a new savings plan at the end of the term are also unique features that provide flexibility and convenience for members."}, {"Would you be more likely to use this product if there was a mobile app available?": "Yes, I would be more likely to use this product if there was a mobile app available. As a software developer, I am very comfortable using technology to manage my finances, and having a mobile app would make it more convenient for me to check on my savings progress and make any necessary adjustments to my plan on the go."}, {"On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to recommend this product to a family member?": "As someone who values financial stability and maximizing my return on investment, I would rate this product as a 8 out of 10. The unique features such as savings challenges and rewards, financial education resources, and penalty-free withdrawal make it a compelling option for someone who is looking to save for a specific goal. However, the minimum deposit of $100 and the interest rate offered would need to be competitive compared to other savings accounts for me to recommend it to a family member."}]
