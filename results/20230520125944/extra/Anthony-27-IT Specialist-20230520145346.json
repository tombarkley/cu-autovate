[{"What financial goals do you have for the short term (next 6-12 months)?": "My short-term financial goals are to save for a down payment on a bigger house and to build up my emergency fund. I also want to pay off some of my high-interest credit card debt."}, {"What financial goals do you have for the long term (next 5-10 years)?": "My long-term financial goals are to save for my daughter's college education and to build up my retirement savings. I also hope to be able to travel more with my family and maybe even start a small business on the side."}, {"How satisfied are you with your current savings plan?": "I'm fairly satisfied with my current savings plan, but I'm always looking for ways to improve it. I try to automate my savings as much as possible and set aside a portion of each paycheck for different goals. However, unexpected expenses can sometimes throw me off track."}, {"Have you considered any non-traditional savings options such as CDs or money market accounts? If not, why?": "Yes, I have considered CD and money market accounts in the past. However, I tend to prefer more flexible savings options that allow me to access my funds if needed. I also like to compare interest rates and fees before deciding on a new account."}, {"What are some obstacles that prevent you from saving more money?": "One of the biggest obstacles is unexpected expenses, like car repairs or medical bills. It can also be challenging to balance saving with other financial priorities, such as paying off debt or contributing to retirement accounts. Lastly, sometimes it's hard to resist the temptation to spend money on things that I don't necessarily need."}, {"What are your thoughts on taking risks with investments when it comes to saving?": "Personally, I'm more comfortable with low-risk investments that offer steady returns over time. Although I understand that higher-risk investments can potentially yield greater returns, I prefer to prioritize preserving my savings rather than risking losing them."}, {"In general, what types of financial products interest you?": "I'm interested in financial products that offer convenience and flexibility, such as online banking and mobile apps. I also appreciate products that reward responsible behavior, like cashback rewards for using a credit card responsibly. Lastly, I'm interested in products that help me save money efficiently and effectively, like automatic savings plans or high-yield savings accounts."}, {"Do you have any experience with credit unions? If so, what made you choose a credit union over a bank?": "Yes, I have experience with credit unions. I chose a credit union over a bank because of their focus on community and member service. I appreciate that credit unions are not-for-profit organizations that prioritize the needs of their members over shareholders. Additionally, I've found that credit unions often offer competitive rates and lower fees compared to traditional banks."}, {"What are the top features/benefits that would draw you to a new financial product?": "The top features/benefits that would draw me to a new financial product are convenience and flexibility, competitive rates and fees, and rewards for responsible behavior. I value products that offer online and mobile banking options, allow for easy money transfers, and have no or low maintenance fees. I also appreciate products with high-interest savings accounts and credit cards that offer cashback rewards or points for purchases made. Lastly, I'm drawn to products that provide financial education resources to help me make informed decisions about my finances."}, {"Have you found any trends or innovations among other financial institutions that you think would benefit our credit union?": "Yes, I've noticed a few trends and innovations that could benefit your credit union. One trend is the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide personalized financial advice and insights to customers. This can help customers make informed decisions about their finances and improve their overall financial health. Another innovation is the use of biometric authentication, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, to improve security and make transactions more convenient for customers. Additionally, I've seen some institutions offer \"round-up\" savings programs, where purchases made with a debit card are rounded up to the nearest dollar and the difference is deposited into a savings account. This can be an effective way to encourage saving without requiring much effort from customers."}, {"How important is earning interest/useful rewards on a savings account to you?": "Earning interest on a savings account is very important to me. I want my money to work for me and grow over time, so I look for accounts with high-interest rates. Additionally, rewards programs can be useful if they align with my spending habits and provide tangible benefits. For example, cashback rewards on purchases or points that can be redeemed for travel or merchandise can be appealing. However, the interest rate is typically more important to me than rewards programs."}, {"What percentage of your monthly budget do you typically save?": "I try to save at least 20% of my monthly budget. However, this can vary depending on my expenses and financial goals for the month. I prioritize saving for my long-term goals, such as a down payment on a house or my daughter's college education, but also make sure to have enough money for my day-to-day expenses."}, {"Would you be willing to enroll in a new savings program if it meant securing better rates/protections, and greater long-term finance stabilization?": "Yes, I would definitely be interested in a savings program that provides better rates and protections, as well as greater long-term financial stability. As someone who values financial stability and security, I am always looking for ways to make my money work harder for me while also minimizing risk. If the credit union can offer a savings program that aligns with my financial goals and provides tangible benefits, I would be open to enrolling."}, {"What fees associated with the servicing of traditional deposit accounts do you find most bothersome?": "I find monthly maintenance fees and overdraft fees to be the most bothersome. Monthly maintenance fees can add up over time, eating into any interest I may earn on my account balance. Overdraft fees can also be costly and unexpected, especially if I am not closely monitoring my account balance or have a sudden increase in expenses. As someone who values transparency and predictability when it comes to my finances, I would prefer to avoid these types of fees whenever possible."}, {"Given the significant period of low interest rates historically. How does that affect your saving attitude?": "The low interest rates have definitely affected my saving attitude. With the low rates, it feels like your savings are not growing as fast. It also makes me more conscious about where I put my money and finding ways to make my money work harder for me. I am more likely to explore different savings options that can provide better returns than traditional savings accounts, while still minimizing risk. Overall, I am more cautious with my spending and more strategic with my investments in order to maximize my savings potential."}]
