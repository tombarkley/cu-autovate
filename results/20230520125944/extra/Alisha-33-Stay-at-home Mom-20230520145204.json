[{"What financial goals do you have for the short term (next 6-12 months)?": "My financial goals for the next 6-12 months are to save enough money to take my family on a summer vacation and to pay off some credit card debt."}, {"What financial goals do you have for the long term (next 5-10 years)?": "My long term financial goals are to save for my children's college education, to buy a house, and to have a comfortable retirement."}, {"How satisfied are you with your current savings plan?": "I'm fairly satisfied with my current savings plan, although I always feel like there's room for improvement. I try to save a little bit every month and make sure I have an emergency fund."}, {"Have you considered any non-traditional savings options such as CDs or money market accounts? If not, why?": "Yes, I have considered CDs and money market accounts in the past, but I haven't pursued them because the interest rates were not very appealing. I've mostly stuck with savings accounts because they feel more accessible and flexible."}, {"What are some obstacles that prevent you from saving more money?": "As a stay-at-home mom, my biggest obstacle is having a limited income. We try to live within our means and budget carefully, but it can be tough to save much beyond our necessary expenses. Additionally, unexpected expenses like car repairs or medical bills can eat into our savings quickly."}, {"What are your thoughts on taking risks with investments when it comes to saving?": "Personally, I prefer to avoid taking significant risks with our savings. I'd rather have the peace of mind that comes with knowing our money is safe and accessible than the chance of earning a higher rate of return. That being said, I do think it's important to diversify investments to some degree and not keep all of our eggs in one basket."}, {"In general, what types of financial products interest you?": "As a mom, I'm interested in financial products that provide stability and flexibility. For example, I like savings accounts that offer a competitive interest rate and don't have complicated requirements or fees. I also appreciate products that make it easy to manage my finances online or through a mobile app since I'm often on the go. Finally, I'm always looking for ways to earn rewards or bonuses for using financial products, especially if they can help me save money on everyday expenses."}, {"Do you have any experience with credit unions? If so, what made you choose a credit union over a bank?": "Yes, I've been a member of a credit union for several years now. What initially drew me to a credit union was the personalized service and community focus. I liked that I could speak with a representative who knew me by name and that the credit union was invested in supporting local organizations. Additionally, credit unions often offer more competitive interest rates and lower fees compared to traditional banks. Overall, I feel like I'm part of a smaller, more connected financial community by banking with a credit union."}, {"What are the top features/benefits that would draw you to a new financial product?": "For me, the top features/benefits that would draw me to a new financial product are flexibility, convenience, and rewards. I want a product that is easy to use and fits into my busy schedule as a stay-at-home mom. I also want a product that offers flexibility in terms of how I can access my funds or manage my account. Finally, I'm motivated by the prospect of earning rewards or bonuses for using a financial product, especially if they can help me save money on everyday expenses. If a new product can offer these benefits, it would definitely catch my attention."}, {"Have you found any trends or innovations among other financial institutions that you think would benefit our credit union?": "One trend I've noticed among financial institutions is the use of digital tools and technology to enhance the customer experience. For example, some banks now offer mobile apps that allow customers to deposit checks, transfer money, and even apply for loans from their smartphones. I think this type of technology could be really beneficial for a credit union, as it would make banking more convenient and accessible for busy members. Additionally, I've seen some institutions offer incentives or rewards for using digital tools, which could be another way to encourage members to try new products and services. Overall, I think embracing technology and offering more digital options could be a smart move for our credit union."}, {"How important is earning interest/useful rewards on a savings account to you?": "Earning interest on a savings account is definitely important to me, as it allows me to grow my savings over time without having to do anything extra. I also appreciate rewards or bonuses that can help me save money on everyday expenses, like cashback on purchases or discounts on services. However, I think it's important for any rewards program to be easy to understand and use, as well as actually provide value to the customer. If a rewards program is confusing or doesn't offer much benefit, I'm less likely to be motivated by it."}, {"What percentage of your monthly budget do you typically save?": "As a stay-at-home mom, my income is limited and I have to be careful with my spending. However, I still try to save as much as I can each month, even if it's just a small amount. On average, I would say I save around 10-15% of my monthly budget, but this can vary depending on our expenses for the month. My priority is always to cover our basic needs and bills first, then allocate any remaining funds towards savings or other goals."}, {"Would you be willing to enroll in a new savings program if it meant securing better rates/protections, and greater long-term finance stabilization?": "Yes, I would definitely be interested in a new savings program if it offered better rates or protections than what I currently have. As someone who values long-term financial stability, I'm always looking for ways to improve my financial situation and ensure that my savings are secure. However, I would need to see the specifics of the program and understand how it works before making a decision. It's important to me that any new product I use is transparent, easy to use, and doesn't come with hidden fees or requirements."}, {"What fees associated with the servicing of traditional deposit accounts do you find most bothersome?": "The fees that bother me the most are ones that feel unnecessary or excessive. For example, I don't like being charged for using an ATM that isn't affiliated with my bank or credit union, especially if it's a small fee that adds up over time. I also don't like being charged for not maintaining a certain balance in my account or for making too many transactions in a month. These types of fees can feel punitive and make it harder for me to manage my finances. I prefer deposit accounts that have transparent fee structures and make it easy for me to avoid extra charges."}, {"Given the significant period of low interest rates historically. How does that affect your saving attitude?": "Low interest rates have definitely made it more challenging to save for long-term financial goals and earn meaningful returns on my savings. However, I still believe that saving is important and try to prioritize it as much as possible. I also try to be strategic about where I keep my savings, such as in high-yield savings accounts or CDs with higher interest rates. While the returns may not be as strong as they were in the past, every little bit helps and I believe that any progress towards my financial goals is worth it. Ultimately, I think it's important to stay optimistic and focused on the long-term benefits of saving, even during periods of low interest rates or market volatility."}]
