[{"What financial goals are you currently working towards?": "As a stay-at-home mom, my current financial goals are centered around managing household expenses while still being able to save for my children's education and our family's future. I also hope to eventually open my own Etsy store and would love to have access to financial tools that can help me achieve that goal."}, {"Have you ever used any non-traditional savings methods? If so, which ones?": "Yes, I have used non-traditional methods like automated savings apps that round up my purchases to the nearest dollar and invest the difference. I also use cash-back rewards from my credit card to contribute to my savings goals."}, {"What motivates you to save money?": "As a mother, my biggest motivation to save money is to provide for my children's needs and to ensure financial stability for our family. I also find personal satisfaction in achieving my own financial goals and being able to pursue my hobbies and passions."}, {"What challenges have you faced when trying to save money?": "One of the biggest challenges I face when trying to save money is finding a balance between household duties and my children's needs. As a stay-at-home mom, my time and energy are focused on caring for my family, which can make it difficult to find time to work on financial planning. Finding affordable childcare is also a challenge that can hinder my ability to work outside the home."}, {"What types of financial products have you found most helpful in achieving your goals?": "I have found that savings accounts with competitive interest rates and low fees, as well as budgeting tools and resources, have been helpful in achieving my financial goals. Additionally, credit cards with cash back or rewards programs that fit my spending patterns have allowed me to earn rewards while making necessary purchases."}, {"What features or benefits do you look for in a financial product?": "When I am looking for a financial product, I prioritize low fees, competitive interest rates, and user-friendly online banking tools.

It would be helpful to have a product specifically designed for parents to save for childcare expenses, with features such as automatic transfers and employer contributions. Additionally, I believe that there could be more innovative credit products that are tailored towards individuals with less traditional income sources, such as freelancers or gig workers."}]
