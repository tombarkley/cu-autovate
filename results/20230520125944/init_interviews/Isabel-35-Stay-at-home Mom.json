[{"What financial goals are you currently working towards?": "As a stay-at-home mom, my financial goals are centered around managing the household budget and ensuring that we can provide a happy childhood for our children. I also hope to re-enter the workforce part-time when the time is right and save for future travel opportunities."}, {"Have you ever used any non-traditional savings methods? If so, which ones?": "As a family, we haven't used any non-traditional savings methods. We typically stick to savings accounts and budgeting to manage our finances. However, I have heard of other families using methods like the envelope system or automatic savings apps to help them save more effectively."}, {"What motivates you to save money?": "As a mom, my primary motivation for saving money is to provide a happy and stable life for my children. This means having money set aside for emergencies or unexpected expenses, as well as saving for future goals like their education or family vacations. Additionally, I find it personally rewarding to see our savings grow and know that we are making progress towards our financial goals."}, {"What challenges have you faced when trying to save money?": "One of the biggest challenges we face when trying to save money is managing our household budget. With a family to take care of, there are always unexpected expenses that come up and it can be difficult to balance everything. Additionally, finding time for myself and my spouse can sometimes be a challenge, which can make it harder to stick to a strict budget. Finally, as a stay-at-home mom, I have to be mindful of ensuring my children get enough socialization opportunities, which can sometimes come with additional costs."}, {"What types of financial products have you found most helpful in achieving your goals?": "I find that having a mix of traditional savings accounts and investment products has been most helpful in achieving my financial goals. Savings accounts provide a safe and accessible place to keep our emergency fund and short-term savings, while investment products like mutual funds and bonds offer the potential for higher returns over the long-term. Additionally, I appreciate financial products that come with low fees and minimal paperwork, as it makes it easier for me to manage our finances and stay on top of our investments."}, {"What features or benefits do you look for in a financial product?": "As a mom and someone who manages our household finances, I look for financial products that offer convenience, safety, and flexibility. Specifically, I appreciate features like online banking and mobile apps that make it easy to check my account balances and transfer money. Safety is also very important to me, so I look for financial products that are FDIC-insured or that have other protections in place. Finally, I value financial products that offer flexibility, such as the ability to withdraw funds penalty-free or to adjust our investment mix as needed."}, {"Are there any financial products that you feel are missing from the market?": "As someone who is interested in saving for my children's education, I would appreciate a financial product that offers more flexibility and tax benefits than traditional 529 plans. Specifically, I would like to see a product that allows for contributions to be used for a wider range of educational expenses, such as private K-12 schooling, tutoring, and vocational training. Additionally, I think it would be helpful if this product offered tax-free withdrawals for any education-related expense, not just qualified higher education expenses."}]
