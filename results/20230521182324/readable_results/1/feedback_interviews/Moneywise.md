- As someone who values personalized financial advice and insights, I would rate my likelihood of recommending this digital banking service to a friend as a 9 out of 10. The features offered by Moneywise seem to align with the needs and goals of many of my friends, and I appreciate the use of machine learning algorithms to provide personalized insights. However, I would need to learn more about the security measures in place before fully committing to recommending the service to others.
